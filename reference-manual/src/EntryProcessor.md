## Entry Processor

Hazelcast supports entry processing. An entry processor is a function that executes your code on a map entry in an atomic way. 

An entry processor is a good option if you perform bulk processing on an `IMap`. Usually, you perform a loop of keys: executing `IMap.get(key)`, mutating the value, and finally putting the entry back in the map using `IMap.put(key,value)`.  If you perform this process from a client or from a member where the keys do not exist, you effectively perform 2 network hops for each update: the first to retrieve the data and the second to update the mutated value.

If you are doing the process described above, you should consider using entry processors. An entry processor executes a read and updates upon the member where the data resides.  This eliminates the costly network hops described previously.

### Performing Fast In-Memory Map Operations

An entry processor enables fast in-memory operations on your map without you having to worry about locks or concurrency issues. You can apply it to a single map entry or to all map entries. It supports choosing target entries using predicates. You do not need any explicit lock on entry: Hazelcast locks the entry, runs the EntryProcessor, and then unlocks the entry.

Hazelcast sends the entry processor to each cluster member and these members apply it to map entries. Therefore, if you add more members, your processing completes faster.

#### Using OBJECT In-Memory Format

If entry processing is the major operation for a map and if the map consists of complex objects, you should use `OBJECT` as the `in-memory-format` to minimize serialization cost. By default, the entry value is stored as a byte array (`BINARY` format). When it is stored as an object (`OBJECT` format), then the entry processor is applied directly on the object. In that case, no serialization or deserialization is performed. But if there is a defined event listener, a new entry value will be serialized when passing to the event publisher service.

#### Entry Processing with IMap Methods

The methods below are in the IMap interface for entry processing.

* `executeOnKey` processes an entry mapped by a key.
* `executeOnKeys` processes entries mapped by a collection of keys.
* `submitToKey` processes an entry mapped by a key while listening to event status.
* `executeOnEntries` processes all entries in a map.
* `executeOnEntries` can also process all entries in a map with a defined predicate.

```java
/**
 * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to the entry mapped by the key.
 * Returns the object which is the result of the process() method of EntryProcessor.
 */
Object executeOnKey( K key, EntryProcessor entryProcessor );

/**
 * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to the entries mapped by the collection of keys.
 * Returns the results mapped by each key in the collection.
 */
Map<K, Object> executeOnKeys( Set<K> keys, EntryProcessor entryProcessor );

/**
 * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to the entry mapped by the key with
 * specified ExecutionCallback to listen to event status and return immediately.
 */
void submitToKey( K key, EntryProcessor entryProcessor, ExecutionCallback callback );


/**
 * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to all entries in the map.
 * Returns the results mapped by each key in the map.
 */
Map<K, Object> executeOnEntries( EntryProcessor entryProcessor );
	   
/**
 * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to the entries in the map which satisfies 
 provided predicate.
 * Returns the results mapped by each key in the map.
 */
Map<K, Object> executeOnEntries( EntryProcessor entryProcessor, Predicate predicate );
```

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE***: *Entry Processors run via Operation Threads that are dedicated to specific partitions.  Therefore, with long running Entry Processor executions, other partition operations such as `map.put(key)` cannot be processed. With this in mind, it is a good practice to make your Entry Processor executions as quick as possible.*


#### `EntryProcessor` Interface

The following is the `EntryProcessor` interface:

```java
public interface EntryProcessor<K, V> extends Serializable {
  Object process( Map.Entry<K, V> entry );

  EntryBackupProcessor<K, V> getBackupProcessor();
}
```

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE***: *If you want to execute a task on a single key, you can also use `executeOnKeyOwner` provided by Executor Service. But, in this case, you need to perform a lock and serialization.*

When using the `executeOnEntries` method, if the number of entries is high and you do need the results, then returning null in `process()` method is a good practice. By returning null, results of the processing is not stored in the map and hence out of memory errors are eliminated.

#### Processing Backup Entries

If your code modifies the data, then you should also provide a processor for backup entries. This is required to prevent the primary map entries from having different values than the backups; it causes the entry processor to be applied both on the primary and backup entries.

```java
public interface EntryBackupProcessor<K, V> extends Serializable {
    void processBackup( Map.Entry<K, V> entry );
}
```

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE***: *It is possible that an Entry Processor can see that a key exists but its backup processor may not find it at the run time due to an unsent backup of a previous operation (e.g. a previous put operation). In those situations, Hazelcast internally/eventually will synchronize those owner and backup partitions so you will not lose any data. When coding an `EntryBackupProcessor`, you should take that case into account, otherwise `NullPointerException` can be seen since `Map.Entry.getValue()` may return `null`.*
