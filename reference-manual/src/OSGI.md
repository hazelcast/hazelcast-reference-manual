# OSGI

This chapter explains how Hazelcast is supported on OSGI (Open Service Gateway Initiatives) environments.

## OSGI Support

Hazelcast bundles provide OSGI services so that Hazelcast users can manage (create, access, shutdown) Hazelcast instances through these services on OSGI environments. When you enable the property `hazelcast.osgi.start` (default is disabled), when an Hazelcast OSGI service is activated, a default Hazelcast instance is created automatically.

Created Hazelcast instances can be served as an OSGI service that the other Hazelcast bundles can access. Registering created Hazelcast instances behavior is enabled by default; you can disable it using the property `hazelcast.osgi.register.disabled`.

Each Hazelcast bundle provides a different OSGI service. Their instances can be grouped (clustered) together to prevent possible compatibility issues between different Hazelcast versions/bundles. This grouping behavior is enabled by default and you disable it using the property `hazelcast.osgi.grouping.disabled`.

Hazelcast OSGI service's lifecycle (and the owned/created instances's lifecycles) is the same with the owner Hazelcast bundles. When the bundle is stopped (deactivated), the owned service and Hazelcast instances are also deactivated/shutdown and deregistered automatically. When the bundle is re-activated, its service is registered again.

The Hazelcast Enterprise JAR package is also an OSGI bundle like the Hazelcast Open Source JAR package.

## API

**`HazelcastOSGiService`:** Contract point for Hazelcast services on top of OSGI. Registered to `org.osgi.framework.BundleContext` as the OSGI service so the other bundles can access and use Hazelcast on the OSGI environment through this service.

**`HazelcastOSGiInstance`:** Contract point for `HazelcastInstance` implementations based on OSGI service. `HazelcastOSGiService` provides proxy Hazelcast instances typed `HazelcastOSGiInstance` which is a subtype of `HazelcastInstance` and these instances delegate all calls to the underlying `HazelcastInstance`.

## Configuring Hazelcast OSGI Support

`HazelcastOSGiService` uses three configurations:

- **`hazelcast.osgi.start`:** If this property is enabled (it is disabled by default), when an `HazelcastOSGiService` is activated, a default Hazelcast instance is created automatically.
<br></br>
- **`hazelcast.osgi.register.disabled`:** If this property is disabled (it is disabled by default), when a Hazelcast instance is created by `HazelcastOSGiService`, the created `HazelcastOSGiInstance` is registered automatically as OSGI service with type of `HazelcastOSGiInstance` and it is deregistered automatically when the created `HazelcastOSGiInstance` is shutdown.
<br></br>
- **`hazelcast.osgi.grouping.disabled`:** If this property is disabled (it is disabled by default), every created `HazelcastOSGiInstance` is grouped as their owner `HazelcastOSGiService` and do not join each other unless no group name is specified in the `GroupConfig` of `Config`.

## Design

`HazelcastOSGiService` is specific to each Hazelcast bundle. This means that every Hazelcast bundle has its own `HazelcastOSGiService` instance.

Every Hazelcast bundle registers its `HazelcastOSGiService` instances via Hazelcast Bundle Activator (`com.hazelcast.osgi.impl.Activator`) while they are being started, and it deregisters its `HazelcastOSGiService` instances while they are being stopped.

Each `HazelcastOSGiService` instance has a different service ID as the combination of Hazelcast version and artifact type (`OSS` or `EE`). Examples are `3.6#OSS`, `3.6#EE`, `3.7#OSS`, `3.7#EE`, etc.

`HazelcastOSGiService` instance lifecycle is the same with the owner Hazelcast bundle. This means that when the owner bundle is deactivated, the owned `HazelcastOSGiService` instance is deactivated, and all active Hazelcast instances that are created and served by that `HazelcastOSGiService` instance are also shutdown and deregistered. When the Hazelcast bundle is re-activated, its `HazelcastOSGiService` instance is registered again as the OSGI service.

## Using Hazelcast OSGI Service

### Getting Hazelcast OSGI Service Instances

You can access all `HazelcastOSGiService` instances through `org.osgi.framework.BundleContext` for each Hazelcast bundle as follows:

```java
for (ServiceReference serviceRef : context.getServiceReferences(HazelcastOSGiService.class.getName(), null)) {
    HazelcastOSGiService service = (HazelcastOSGiService) context.getService(serviceRef);
    String serviceId = service.getId();
    ...
} 
```
 
### Managing and Using Hazelcast instances

You can use `HazelcastOSGiService` instance to create and shutdown Hazelcast instances on OSGI environments. The created Hazelcast instances are `HazelcastOSGiInstance` typed (which is sub-type of `HazelcastInstance`) and are just proxies to the underlying Hazelcast instance. There are several methods in `HazelcastOSGiService` to use Hazelcast instances on OSGI environments as shown below.

```java
// Get the default Hazelcast instance owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
// Returns null if `HAZELCAST_OSGI_START` is not enabled
HazelcastOSGiInstance defaultInstance = hazelcastOsgiService.getDefaultHazelcastInstance();
 
 
// Creates a new Hazelcast instance with default configurations as owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
HazelcastOSGiInstance newInstance1 = hazelcastOsgiService.newHazelcastInstance();
 
 
// Creates a new Hazelcast instance with specified configuration as owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
Config config = new Config();
config.setInstanceName("OSGI-Instance");
...
HazelcastOSGiInstance newInstance2 = hazelcastOsgiService.newHazelcastInstance(config);
  
// Gets the Hazelcast instance with the name `OSGI-Instance`, which is `newInstance2` created above
HazelcastOSGiInstance instance = hazelcastOsgiService.getHazelcastInstanceByName("OSGI-Instance");
  
// Shuts down the Hazelcast instance with name `OSGI-Instance`, which is `newInstance2`
hazelcastOsgiService.shutdownHazelcastInstance(instance);
  
// Print all active Hazelcast instances owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
for (HazelcastOSGiInstance instance : hazelcastOsgiService.getAllHazelcastInstances()) {
    System.out.println(instance);
}
  
// Shuts down all Hazelcast instances owned by `hazelcastOsgiService`
hazelcastOsgiService.shutdownAll();
```
