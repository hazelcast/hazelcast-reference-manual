## Management Center

Hazelcast Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your cluster members running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze and browse your data structures in detail, update map configurations and take thread dump from members. With its scripting and console module, you can run scripts (JavaScript, Groovy, etc.) and commands on your members.

### Installing Management Center

You have two options for installing Hazelcast Management Center. You can either deploy the `mancenter`-*version*`.war` application into your Java application server/container or you can start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line and then have the Hazelcast cluster members communicate with that web application. This means that your members should know the URL of the `mancenter` application before they start.

Here are the steps.

- Download the latest Hazelcast ZIP from <a href="http://www.hazelcast.org/download/" target="_blank">hazelcast.org</a>. The ZIP contains the `mancenter`-*version*`.war` file.
- You can directly start `mancenter`-*version*`.war` file from the command line. The following command will start Hazelcast Management Center on port 8080 with context root 'mancenter' (`http://localhost:8080/mancenter`).

```java
java -jar mancenter-*version*.war 8080 mancenter
```

- Or, instead of starting at the command line, you can deploy it to your web server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.). Let us say it is running at `http://localhost:8080/mancenter`.
- After you perform the above steps, make sure that `http://localhost:8080/mancenter` is up.
- Configure your Hazelcast members by adding the URL of your web application to your `hazelcast.xml`. Hazelcast members will send their states to this URL.

```xml
<management-center enabled="true">
    http://localhost:8080/mancenter
</management-center>
```

- Start your Hazelcast cluster.
- Browse to `http://localhost:8080/mancenter` and setup your [administrator account](#getting-started-to-management-center) explained in the next section.

### Getting Started to Management Center

Once you browse to `http://localhost:8080/mancenter` and since you are going to use Management Center for the first time, the following dialog box appears.

<img src="images/SignUp-Popup.jpg" style="width:413px;height:345px;">


![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If you already created an administrator account before, a login dialog box appears instead.*


It asks you to create a username and password and give a valid e-mail address of yours. Once you press the **Sign Up** button, your administrator account credentials are created and the following dialog box appears.


<img src="images/ConnectCluster.jpg" style="width:313px;height:243px;">


"Select Cluster to Connect" dialog box lists the clusters that send statistics to Management Center. You can either select a cluster to connect using the **Connect** button or enter your Management Center license key using the **Enter License** button. Management Center can be used without a license if the cluster that you want to monitor has at most 2 nodes.

If you have a Management Center license and press the **Enter License** button, the following dialog box appears.


<img src="images/EnterLicense.jpg" style="width:312px;height:244px;">


When you try to connect to a cluster that has more than 2 nodes without entering a license key or if your license key is expired, the following dialog box appears.

<img src="images/ExpiredLicense.jpg" style="width:313px;height:244px;">


Here, you can either choose to connect to a cluster without providing a license key or to enter your license key. If you choose to continue without a license, Management Center still continues to function but you will only be able to monitor up to 2 nodes of your cluster.

Management Center creates a folder with the name `mancenter` under your `user/home` folder to save data files and above settings/license information. You can change the data folder by setting the `hazelcast.mancenter.home` system property. Please see the [System Properties section](#system-properties) to see the description of this property and to learn how to set a system property.

#### Tabbed View

Each time you select an item from the toolbar or menu, the item is added to the main view as a tab, as shown below.

![](images/NonHMCTabbedView.jpg)

In the above example, *Home*, *Scripting*, *Console*, *queue1* and *map1* windows can be seen as tabs. Windows can be closed using the ![](images/CloseIcon.jpg) icon on each tab (except the Home Page; it cannot be closed).


### Management Center Home Page

This is the first page appearing after logging in. It gives an overview of the connected cluster. The following subsections describe each portion of the page.

#### CPU Utilization

This part of the page provides load and utilization information for the CPUs for each node (cluster member), as shown below.

![](images/NonHMCCPUUtil.jpg)

The first column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. The next columns list the system load averages on each node for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. These average values are calculated as the sum of the count of runnable entities running on and queued to the available CPUs averaged over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. This calculation is operating system specific, typically a damped time-dependent average. If system load average is not available, these columns show negative values.

The last column (**Chart**) graphically shows the recent load on the CPUs. When you move the mouse cursor on a chart, you can see the CPU load at the time where the cursor is placed. Charts under this column shows the CPU loads approximately for the last 2 minutes. If recent CPU load is not available, you will see a negative value.

#### Memory Utilization

This part of the page provides information related to memory usages for each node (cluster member), as shown below.

![](images/NonHMCMemoryUtil.jpg)

The first column lists the nodes with their IPs and ports. The next columns show the used and free memories out of the total memory reserved for Hazelcast usage, in real-time. The **Max** column lists the maximum memory capacity of each node and the **Percent** column lists the percentage value of used memory out of the maximum memory. The last column (**Chart**) shows the memory usage of nodes graphically. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the memory usage at the time where the cursor is placed. Graphs under this column shows the memory usages approximately for the last 2 minutes.

#### Memory Distribution

This part of the page graphically provides the cluster wise breakdown of memory, as shown below. The blue area is the memory used by maps. The dark yellow area is the memory used by both non-Hazelcast entities and all Hazelcast entities except the map (i.e. the memory used by all entities subtracted by the memory used by map). The green area is the free memory out of the whole cluster`s memory capacity.

![](images/Home-MemoryDistribution.jpg)

In the above example, you can see 0.32% of the total memory is used by Hazelcast maps (it can be seen by placing the mouse cursor on it), 58.75% is used by non-Hazelcast entities and 40.85% of the total memory is free.

#### Map Memory Distribution

This part is the breakdown of the blue area shown in the **Memory Distribution** graph explained above. It provides the percentage values of the memories used by each map, out of the total cluster memory reserved for all Hazelcast maps.

![](images/Home-MapMemoryDistribution.jpg)

In the above example, you can see 49.55% of the total map memory is used by **map1** and 49.55% is used by **map2**.

#### Partition Distribution

This pie chart shows what percentage of partitions each node (cluster member) has, as shown below.

![](images/Home-PartitionDistribution.jpg)

You can see each node's partition percentages by placing the mouse cursor on the chart. In the above example, you can see the node "127.0.0.1:5708" has 5.64% of the total partition count (which is 271 by default and configurable, please see the `hazelcast.partition.count` property explained in the [System Properties section](#system-properties)).


### Monitoring Caches

You can monitor your caches' metrics by clicking the cache name listed on the left panel under **Caches** menu item. A new tab for monitoring that cache instance is opened on the right, as shown below.

![](images/ManCenter-Caches.jpg)

You can open both of these charts as separate windows using the ![](images/ChangeWindowIcon.jpg) button placed at top right of each chart; this gives you a clearer view of the chart.

The window titled **Partitions** shows which partitions are assigned to the selected member. **Runtime** is a dynamically updated window tab showing the processor number, the start and up times, and the maximum, total and free memory sizes of the selected member. These values are collected from the default MXBeans provided by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Descriptions from the Javadocs and some explanations are below:

- **Number of Processors**: Number of processors available to the member (JVM).

- **Start Time**: Start time of the member (JVM) in milliseconds.

- **Up Time**: Uptime of the member (JVM) in milliseconds

- **Maximum Memory**: Maximum amount of memory that the member (JVM) will attempt to use.

- **Free Memory**: Amount of free memory in the member (JVM).

- **Used Heap Memory**: Amount of used memory in bytes.

- **Max Heap Memory**: Maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management.

- **Used Non-Heap Memory**: Amount of used memory in bytes.

- **Max Non-Heap Memory**: Maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management.

- **Total Loaded Classes**: Total number of classes that have been loaded since the member (JVM) has started execution.

- **Current Loaded Classes**: Number of classes that are currently loaded in the member (JVM).

- **Total Unloaded Classes**: Total number of classes unloaded since the member (JVM) has started execution.

- **Total Thread Count**: Total number of threads created and also started since the member (JVM) started.

- **Active Thread Count**: Current number of live threads including both daemon and non-daemon threads.

- **Peak Thread Count**: Peak live thread count since the member (JVM) started or peak was reset.

- **Daemon Thread Count**: Current number of live daemon threads.

- **OS: Free Physical Memory**: Amount of free physical memory in bytes.

- **OS: Committed Virtual Memory**: Amount of virtual memory that is guaranteed to be available to the running process in bytes.

- **OS: Total Physical Memory**: Total amount of physical memory in bytes.

- **OS: Free Swap Space**: Amount of free swap space in bytes. Swap space is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space.

- **OS: Total Swap Space**: Total amount of swap space in bytes.

- **OS: Maximum File Descriptor Count**: Maximum number of file descriptors. File descriptor is an integer number that uniquely represents an opened file in the operating system.

- **OS: Open File Descriptor Count**: Number of open file descriptors.

- **OS: Process CPU Time**: CPU time used by the process on which the member (JVM) is running in nanoseconds.

- **OS: Process CPU Load**: Recent CPU usage for the member (JVM) process. This is a double with a value from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads from the member (JVM) process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running threads from the member (JVM) 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the member (JVM) include the application threads as well as the member (JVM) internal threads.

- **OS: System Load Average**: System load average for the last minute. The system load average is the average over a period of time of this sum: (the number of runnable entities queued to the available processors) + (the number of runnable entities running on the available processors). The way in which the load average is calculated is operating system specific but it is typically a damped time-dependent average.

- **OS: System CPU Load**:
Recent CPU usage for the whole system. This is a double with a value from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running 100% of the time during the recent period being observed.

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *These descriptions may vary according to the JVM version or vendor.*

Next to the **Runtime** tab, the **Properties** tab shows the system properties. The **Member Configuration** window shows the XML configuration of the connected Hazelcast cluster.

The **List of Slow Operations** gives an overview of detected slow operations which occurred on that member. The data is collected by the [SlowOperationDetector](#slowoperationdetector).

![](images/ListOfSlowOperations.png)

Click on an entry to open a dialog which shows the stacktrace and detailed information about each slow invocation of this operation.

![](images/SlowOperationDetail.png)

Besides the aforementioned monitoring charts and windows, you can also perform operations on the selected member through this page. The operation buttons are located at the top right of the page, as explained below:

-	**Run GC**: Press this button to execute garbage collection on the selected member. A notification stating that the GC execution was successful will be shown.
-	**Thread Dump**: Press this button to take a thread dump of the selected member and show it as a separate dialog to the user.
-	**Shutdown Node**: Press this button to shutdown the selected member.

### Scripting

You can use the scripting feature of this tool to execute codes on the cluster. To open this feature as a tab, select **Scripting** located at the toolbar on top. Once selected, the scripting feature opens as shown below.

![](images/scripting.jpg)

In this window, the **Scripting** part is the actual coding editor. You can select the members on which the code will execute from the **Members** list shown at the right side of the window. Below the members list, a combo box enables you to select a scripting language: currently, JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy and Python languages are supported. After you write your script and press the **Execute** button, you can see the execution result in the **Result** part of the window.

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *To use the scripting languages other than JavaScript on a member, the libraries for those languages should be placed in the classpath of that member.*

There are **Save** and **Delete** buttons on the top right of the scripting editor. To save your scripts, press the **Save** button after you type a name for your script into the field next to this button. The scripts you saved are listed in the **Saved Scripts** part of the window, located at the bottom right of the page. Click on a saved script from this list to execute or edit it. If you want to remove a script that you wrote and saved before, select it from this list and press the **Delete** button.

In the scripting engine you have a `HazelcastInstance` bonded to a variable named `hazelcast`. You can invoke any method that `HazelcastInstance` has via the `hazelcast` variable. You can see example usage for JavaScript below.

```javascript
var name = hazelcast.getName();
var node = hazelcast.getCluster().getLocalMember();
var employees = hazelcast.getMap("employees");
employees.put("1","John Doe");
employees.get("1"); // will return "John Doe"
```


### Executing Console Commands

The Management Center has a console feature that enables you to execute commands on the cluster. For example, you can perform `put`s and `get`s on a map, after you set the namespace with the command `ns <name of your map>`. The same is valid for queues, topics, etc. To execute your command, type it into the field below the console and press **Enter**. Type `help` to see all the commands that you can use.

Open a console window by clicking on the **Console** button located on the toolbar. Below is a sample view with some executed commands.

### Creating Alerts

You can use the alerts feature of this tool to receive alerts and/or e-mail notifications by creating filters. In these filters, you can specify criteria for cluster members or data structures. When the specified criteria are met for a filter, the related alert is shown as a pop-up message on the top right of the page or sent as an e-mail.

Once you click the **Alerts** button located on the toolbar, the page shown below appears.

![](images/Alerts-Home.png)

If you want to enable the Management Center to send e-mail notifications to the Management Center Admin users, you need to configure the SMTP server. To do this, click on the **Create STMP Config** shown above. The form shown below appears.

![](images/CreateSMTPConfig.png)

In this form, specify the e-mail address from which the notifications will be sent and also its password. Then, provide the SMTP server host address and port. Finally, check the **TLS Connection** checkbox if the connection is secured by TLS (Transport Layer Security).

After you provide the required information, click on the **Save Config** button. After a processing period (for a couple of seconds), the form will be closed if the configuration is created successfully. In this case, an e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address you provided in the form stating that the SMTP configuration is successful and e-mail alert system is created.

If not, you will see an error message at the bottom of this form as shown below.   

![](images/SMTPConfigFormWithError.png)

As you can see, the reasons can be wrong SMTP configuration or connectivity problems. In this case, please check the form fields and check for any causes for the connections issues with your server.

**Creating Filters for Cluster Members**

Select **Member Alerts** check box to create filters for some or all members in the cluster. Once selected, the next screen asks for which members the alert will be created. Select the desired members and click on the **Next** button. On the next page (shown below), specify the criteria.

![](images/MemberAlert1.jpg)

You can create alerts when:

-	free memory on the selected member nodes is less than the specified number.
-	used heap memory is larger than the specified number.
-	the number of active threads are less than the specified count.
-	the number of daemon threads are larger than the specified count.

When two or more criteria is specified they will be bound with the logical operator **AND**.

On the next page, give a name for the filter. Then, select whether notification e-mails will be sent to the Management Center Admins using the **Send Email Alert** checkbox. Then, provide a time interval (in seconds) for which the e-mails with the **same notification content** will be sent using the **Email Interval (secs)** field.  Finally, select whether the alert data will be written to the disk (if checked, you can see the alert log at the folder */users/<your user>/mancenter<version>*).

Click on the **Save** button; your filter will be saved and put into the **Filters** part of the page. To edit the filter, click on the ![](images/EditIcon.jpg) icon. To delete it, click on the ![](images/DeleteIcon.jpg) icon.

**Creating Filters for Data Types**

Select the **Data Type Alerts** check box to create filters for data structures. The next screen asks for which data structure (maps, queues, multimaps, executors) the alert will be created. Once a structure is selected, the next screen immediately loads and you then select the data structure instances (i.e. if you selected *Maps*, it will list all the maps defined in the cluster, you can select one map or more). Select as desired, click on the **Next** button, and select the members on which the selected data structure instances will run.

The next screen, as shown below, is the one where you specify the criteria for the selected data structure.

![](images/DataAlert1.jpg)

As the screen shown above shows, you will select an item from the left combo box, select the operator in the middle one, specify a value in the input field, and click on the **Add** button. You can create more than one criteria in this page; those will be bound by the logical operator **AND**.

After you specify the criteria, click the **Next** button. On the next page, give a name for the filter. Then, select whether notification e-mails will be sent to the Management Center Admins using the **Send Email Alert** checkbox. Then, provide a time interval (in seconds) for which the e-mails with the **same notification content** will be sent using the **Email Interval (secs)** field.  Finally, select whether the alert data will be written to the disk (if checked, you can see the alert log at the folder */users/<your user>/mancenter<version>*).

Click on the **Save** button; your filter will be saved and put into the **Filters** part of the page. To edit the filter, click on the ![](images/EditIcon.jpg) icon. To delete it, click on the ![](images/DeleteIcon.jpg) icon.


### Administering Management Center

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *This toolbar item is available only to admin users.

The **Admin** user can add, edit, and remove users and specify the permissions for the users of Management Center. To perform these operations, click on the **Administration** button located on the toolbar. The page below appears.

![](images/admin.jpg)

To add a user to the system, specify the username, e-mail and password in the **Add/Edit User** part of the page. If the user to be added will have administrator privileges, select **isAdmin** checkbox. **Permissions** checkboxes have two values:

-	**Read Only**: If this permission is given to the user, only *Home*, *Documentation* and *Time Travel* items will be visible at the toolbar at that user's session. Also, users with this permission cannot update a [map configuration](#map-config), run a garbage collection and take a thread dump on a cluster member, or shutdown a member (please see [Monitoring Members](#monitoring-members)).
-	**Read/Write**: If this permission is given to the user, *Home*, *Scripting*, *Console*, *Documentation* and *Time Travel* items will be visible. The users with this permission can update a map configuration and perform operations on the members.

After you enter/select all fields, click **Save** button to create the user. You will see the newly created user's username on the left side, in the **Users** part of the page.

To edit or delete a user, select a username listed in the **Users**. Selected user information appears on the right side of the page. To update the user information, change the fields as desired and click the **Save** button. To delete the user from the system, click the **Delete** button.

### Hot Restart

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *This toolbar item is available only to admin users.

In this screen, the admin user can see the cluster state, change the cluster state or shutdown the cluster as seen below.

![](images/HotRestart.png)

**Cluster States**

- **Active**: Cluster will continue to operate without any restriction. All operations are allowed. This is the default state of a cluster.

- **Frozen**: New members are not allowed to join, except the members left during **this** state or **Passive** state. All other operations except migrations are allowed and will operate without any restriction.

- **Passive**: New members are not allowed to join, except the members left during **this** state or **Frozen** state. All operations, except the ones marked with `AllowedDuringPassiveState`, will be rejected immediately.

- **In Transition**: Shows that the cluster state is in transition. This is a temporary and intermediate state. It is not allowed to set it explicitly.

**Changing Cluster State**

![](images/ChangeClusterState.png)

- Click the dropdown menu and choose the state you want your cluster change to. A pop-up will appear and stay on the screen until the state is successfully changed.

![](images/ChangeClusterState-wait.png)

**Shutting Down the Cluster**

- Click the **Shutdown** button. A pop-up will appear and stay on screen until the cluster is successfully shutdown.

![](images/ShutdownCluster.png)


If an exception occurs during the state change or shutdown operation on the cluster, this exception message will be showed on the screen as a notification.

### Checking Past Status with Time Travel

Use the Time Travel toolbar item to check the status of the cluster at a time in the past. When you select it on the toolbar, a small window appears on top of the page, as shown below.

![](images/timetravel.jpg)

To see the cluster status in a past time, you should first enable the Time Travel. Click on the area where it says **OFF** (on the right of Time Travel window). It will turn to **ON** after it asks whether to enable the Time Travel with a dialog: click on **Enable** in the dialog to enable the Time Travel.

Once it is **ON**, the status of your cluster will be stored on your disk as long as your web server is alive.

You can go back in time using the slider and/or calendar and check your cluster's situation at the selected time. All data structures and members can be monitored as if you are using the management center normally (charts and data tables for each data structure and members). Using the arrow buttons placed at both sides of the slider, you can go back or further with steps of 5 seconds. It will show status if Time Travel has been **ON** at the selected time in past; otherwise, all the charts and tables will be shown as empty.

The historical data collected with Time Travel feature are stored in a file database on the disk. These files can be found in the folder `<User's Home Directory>/mancenter<Hazelcast version>`, e.g. `/home/mancenter3.5`. This folder can be changed using the `hazelcast.mancenter.home` property on the server where Management Center is running.

Time travel data files are created monthly. Their file name format is `[group-name]-[year][month].db` and
 `[group-name]-[year][month].lg`. Time travel data is kept in the `*.db` files. The files with the extension `lg` are temporary files created internally and you do not have to worry about them.

Management Center has no automatic way of removing or archiving old time travel data files. They remain in the aforementioned folder until you delete or archive them.


### Management Center Documentation

To see the documentation, click on the **Documentation** button located at the toolbar. Management Center manual will appear as a tab.
