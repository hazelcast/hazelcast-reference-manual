### Discovering Members by TCP

If multicast is not the preferred way of discovery for your environment, then you can configure Hazelcast to be a full TCP/IP cluster. When you configure Hazelcast to discover members by TCP/IP, you must list all or a subset of the members' hostnames and/or IP addresses as cluster members. You do not have to list all of these cluster members, but at least one of the listed members has to be active in the cluster when a new member joins.

To set your Hazelcast to be a full TCP/IP cluster, set the following configuration elements. Please refer to the [tcp-ip element section](#tcp-ip-element) for the full description of the TCP/IP discovery configuration elements.

- Set the `enabled` attribute of the `multicast` element to "false".
- Set the `enabled` attribute of the `aws` element to "false".
- Set the `enabled` attribute of the `tcp-ip` element to "true".
- Set your `member` elements within the `tcp-ip` element.

The following is an example declarative configuration.

```xml
<hazelcast>
   ...
  <properties>
    <property name="hazelcast.discovery.enabled">true</property>
  </properties>
   ...
  <network>
    ...
    <join>
      <multicast enabled="false">
      </multicast>
      <tcp-ip enabled="true">
        <member>machine1</member>
        <member>machine2</member>
        <member>machine3:5799</member>
        <member>192.168.1.0-7</member>
        <member>192.168.1.21</member>
      </tcp-ip>
      ...
    </join>
    ...
  </network>
  ...
</hazelcast>
```

As shown above, you can provide IP addresses or hostnames for `member` elements. You can also give a range of IP addresses, such as `192.168.1.0-7`.

Instead of providing members line by line as shown above, you also have the option to use the `members` element and write comma-separated IP addresses, as shown below.

`<members>192.168.1.0-7,192.168.1.21</members>`

If you do not provide ports for the members, Hazelcast automatically tries the ports 5701, 5702, and so on.

By default, Hazelcast binds to all local network interfaces to accept incoming traffic. You can change this behavior using the system property `hazelcast.socket.bind.any`. If you set this property to `false`, Hazelcast uses the interfaces specified in the `interfaces` element (please refer to the [Interfaces Configuration section](#interfaces)). If no interfaces are provided, then it will try to resolve one interface to bind from the `member` elements.
