### ICache Partition Lost Listener

You can listen to `CachePartitionLostEvent` instances by registering an implementation
of `CachePartitionLostListener`, which is also a sub-interface of `java.util.EventListener`
from `ICache`.

Let's consider the following example code:

```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();
    CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider.getCacheManager();
    Cache<Object, Object> cache = cacheManager.getCache( ... );

    ICache<Object, Object> unwrappedCache = cache.unwrap( ICache.class );

    unwrappedCache.addPartitionLostListener(new CachePartitionLostListener() {
     @Override
     public void partitionLost(CachePartitionLostEvent event) {
       System.out.println(event);
     }
    });
  }
```

Within this example code, a `CachePartitionLostListener` implementation is registered to a cache and assume that this cache is configured with 1 backup. For this particular cache and any of the partitions in the
system, if the partition owner member and its first backup member crash simultaneously, the
given `CachePartitionLostListener` receives a
corresponding `CachePartitionLostEvent`. If only a single member crashes in the cluster,
a `CachePartitionLostEvent` is not fired for this cache since backups for the partitions
owned by the crashed member are kept on other members.

Please refer to the [Partition Lost Listener section](#partition-lost-listener) for more
information about partition lost detection and partition lost events.
