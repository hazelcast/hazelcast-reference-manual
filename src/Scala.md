## Scala


The API for Hazelcast Scala is based on Scala 2.11 and Hazelcast 3.6 releases. However, these are not hard dependencies provided that you include the relevant Hazelcast dependencies.

Please refer to <a href="https://hazelcast.org/clients/scala/" target="_blank">Hazelcast Scala Client</a> for information on its GitHub repository, documentation and supported features.
