## Split-Brain Protection

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The term "quorum" used in this section simply refers to the count of members in the cluster. It does NOT refer to an implementation of Paxos or Raft protocols as used in some NoSQL systems. The mechanism provided in Hazelcast protects the user in case the number of members in a cluster drops below the specified one.*

How to respond to a split-brain scenario depends on whether consistency of data or availability of your application is of primary concern. In either case, because a split-brain scenario is caused by a network failure, you must initiate an effort to identify and correct the network failure. Your cluster cannot be brought back to steady state operation until the underlying network failure is fixed. If consistency is your primary concern, you can use Hazelcast's  Split-Brain Protection feature.

Hazelcast's Split-Brain Protection enables you to specify the minimum cluster size required for operations to occur. This is achieved by defining and configuring a split-brain protection cluster quorum. If the cluster size is below the defined quorum, the operations are rejected and the rejected operations return a `QuorumException` to their callers. Additionally, it is possible to configure a quorum with a user-defined `QuorumFunction` which will be consulted to determine presence of quorum on each cluster membership change.

Your application continues its operations on the remaining operating cluster. Any application instances connected to the cluster with sizes below the defined quorum will be receiving exceptions which, depending on the programming and monitoring setup, should generate alerts. The key point is that rather than applications continuing in error with stale data, they are prevented from doing so.

Split-Brain Protection is supported for the following Hazelcast data structures:

* IMap (for Hazelcast 3.5 and higher versions)
* Transactional Map (for Hazelcast 3.5 and higher versions)
* ICache (for Hazelcast 3.5 and higher versions)
* ILock (for Hazelcast 3.8 and higher versions)
* IQueue (for Hazelcast 3.8 and higher versions)
* IExecutorService, DurableExecutorService, IScheduledExecutorService, MultiMap, ISet, IList, Ringbuffer, Replicated Map, Cardinality Estimator, IAtomicLong, IAtomicReference, ISemaphore, ICountdownLatch (for Hazelcast 3.10 and higher versions)

Each data structure to be protected should have the configuration added to it as explained in the [Configuring Split-Brain Protection section](#configuring-split-brain-protection).

### Time Window for Split-Brain Protection

Cluster Membership is established and maintained by heartbeats. A network partitioning will present some members as being unreachable. While configurable, it is normally seconds or tens of seconds before the cluster is adjusted to exclude unreachable members. The cluster size is based on the currently understood number of members.

For this reason, there will be a time window between the network partitioning and the application of Split-Brain Protection, a time window to detect quorum is not satisfied anymore. Length of this window depends on the failure detector. Given guarantee is, every member will eventually detect the failed members and will reject the operation on the data structure which requires the quorum.

Starting with Hazelcast 3.10, Split-Brain Protection can be configured with new out-of-the-box `QuorumFunction`s which determine presence of quorum independently of the cluster membership manager, taking advantage of heartbeat and other failure-detector information configured on Hazelcast members.  

For more information, please see the [Consistency and Replication Model chapter](#consistency-and-replication-model).


### Configuring Split-Brain Protection



You can set up Split-Brain Protection Cluster Quorum using either declarative or programmatic configuration.

Assume that you have a 7-member Hazelcast Cluster and you want to set the minimum number of four members for the cluster to continue operating. In this case, if a split-brain happens, the sub-clusters of sizes 1, 2, and 3 will be prevented from being used. Only the sub-cluster of four members will be allowed to be used.

![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *It is preferable to have an odd-sized initial cluster size to prevent a single network partitioning (split-brain) from creating two equal sized clusters.*


#### Member count quorum

This type of quorum function determines the presence of quorum based on the count of members in the cluster, as observed by the local member's cluster membership manager and is available since Hazelcast 3.5. The following are map configurations for the example 7-member cluster scenario described above:

**Declarative configuration**

```xml
<hazelcast>
....
<quorum name="quorumRuleWithFourMembers" enabled="true">
  <quorum-size>4</quorum-size>
</quorum>

<map name="default">
<quorum-ref>quorumRuleWithFourMembers</quorum-ref>
</map>
....
</hazelcast>

```

**Programmatic configuration**

```java
QuorumConfig quorumConfig = new QuorumConfig();
quorumConfig.setName("quorumRuleWithFourMembers")
quorumConfig.setEnabled(true);
quorumConfig.setSize(4);

MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig();
mapConfig.setQuorumName("quorumRuleWithFourMembers");

Config config = new Config();
config.addQuorumConfig(quorumConfig);
config.addMapConfig(mapConfig);

```

#### Probabilistic quorum function

The probabilistic quorum function uses a private instance of [`PhiAccrualClusterFailureDetector`](#phi-accrual-failure-detector) which is updated with member heartbeats and its parameters can be fine-tuned to determine the count of live members in the cluster, independently of the cluster's membership manager.

The probabilistic quorum function can be configured with the following parameters:

Parameter | Default Value | Description
:--------------|:---------------|:------
`acceptable-heartbeat-pause-millis`|60000|Duration in milliseconds corresponding to number of potentially lost/delayed heartbeats that will be accepted before considering it to be an anomaly. This margin is important to be able to survive sudden, occasional, pauses in heartbeat arrivals, due to for example garbage collection or network drops. Value must be in range \[heartbeat interval , maximum no heartbeat interval\], otherwise Hazelcast will not start:
`suspicion-threshold`|10|Threshold for suspicion (Ï†) level. A low threshold is prone to generate many wrong suspicions but ensures a quick detection in the event of a real crash. Conversely, a high threshold generates fewer mistakes but needs more time to detect actual crashes.
`max-sample-size`|200|Number of samples to use for calculation of mean and standard deviation of inter-arrival times.
`heartbeat-interval-millis`|5000|Bootstrap the stats with heartbeats that corresponds to this duration in milliseconds, with a rather high standard deviation (since environment is unknown in the beginning).
`min-std-deviation-millis`|100|Minimum standard deviation (in milliseconds) to use for the normal distribution used when calculating phi. Too low standard deviation might result in too much sensitivity for sudden, but normal, deviations in heartbeat inter arrival times.

**Declarative configuration**

```xml
<hazelcast>
  ...
  <quorum enabled="true" name="probabilistic-quorum">
    <quorum-size>3</quorum-size>
    <quorum-type>READ_WRITE</quorum-type>
    <probabilistic-quorum acceptable-heartbeat-pause-millis="5000"
                max-sample-size="500" suspicion-threshold="10" />
  </quorum>
  <set name="split-brain-protected-set">
    <quorum-ref>probabilistic-quorum</quorum-ref>
  </set>
</hazelcast>
```

**Programmatic configuration**

```java
QuorumConfig quorumConfig = 
        QuorumConfig.newProbabilisticQuorumConfigBuilder("probabilist-quorum", 3)
          .withAcceptableHeartbeatPauseMillis(5000)
          .withMaxSampleSize(500)
          .withSuspicionThreshold(10)
          .build();
quorumConfig.setType(QuorumType.READ_WRITE);
SetConfig setConfig = new SetConfig("split-brain-protected-set");
setConfig.setQuorumName("probabilist-quorum");
Config config = new Config();
config.addQuorumConfig(quorumConfig);
config.addSetConfig(setConfig);
```

#### Recently-active quorum function

A quorum with a recently-active quorum function can be used to implement more conservative split brain protection by requiring that a heartbeat has been received from each member within a configurable time window since now.

**Declarative configuration**

```xml
<hazelcast>
  ...
  <quorum enabled="true" name="recently-active-quorum">
    <quorum-size>4</quorum-size>
    <quorum-type>READ_WRITE</quorum-type>
    <recently-active-quorum heartbeat-tolerance-millis="60000" />
  </quorum>
  <set name="split-brain-protected-set">
    <quorum-ref>recently-active-quorum</quorum-ref>
  </set>
</hazelcast>
```

**Programmatic configuration**

```java
QuorumConfig quorumConfig = 
        QuorumConfig.newRecentlyActiveQuorumConfigBuilder("recently-active-quorum", 4, 60000)
                    .build();
quorumConfig.setType(QuorumType.READ_WRITE);
SetConfig setConfig = new SetConfig("split-brain-protected-set");
setConfig.setQuorumName("recently-active-quorum");
Config config = new Config();
config.addQuorumConfig(quorumConfig);
config.addSetConfig(setConfig);
```


#### Quorum configuration reference

Quorum configuration has the following elements:

- `quorum-size`: Minimum number of members required in a cluster for the cluster to remain in an operational state. If the number of members is below the defined minimum at any time, the operations are rejected and the rejected operations return a `QuorumException` to their callers.
- `quorum-type`: Type of the cluster quorum. Available values are READ, WRITE and READ_WRITE.
- `quorum-function-class-name`: Class name of a `QuorumFunction` implementation, allows to configure split-brain protection with a custom quorum function. Cannot be used in conjunction with `probabilistic-quorum` or `recently-active-quorum`.
- `quorum-listeners`: Declaration of quorum listeners which are notified on quorum status changes.
- `probabilistic-quorum`: Configures the quorum with a probabilistic quorum function. Cannot be used in conjunction with `quorum-function-class-name` or `recently-active-quorum`. 
- `recently-active-quorum`: Configures the quorum with a recently-active quorum function. Cannot be used in conjunction with `quorum-function-class-name` or `probabilistic-quorum`.

**Sample configuration with custom QuorumFunction implementation**

```java
package my.domain;

public class CustomQuorumFunction implements QuorumFunction {
        @Override
        public boolean apply(Collection<Member> members) {
            // implement quorum detection logic here
        }
    }
```

```xml
<quorum enabled="true" name="member-count-quorum">
   <quorum-type>READ_WRITE</quorum-type>
   <quorum-size>3</quorum-size>
   <quorum-function-class-name>my.domain.CustomQuorumFunction</quorum-function-class-name>
</quorum>
```

### Configuring Quorum Listeners

You can register quorum listeners to be notified about quorum results. Quorum listeners are local to the member where they are registered, so they receive only events that occurred on that local member.

Quorum listeners can be configured via declarative or programmatic configuration. The following examples are such configurations.

**Declarative:**

```xml
<hazelcast>
....
<quorum name="quorumRuleWithFourMembers" enabled="true">
  <quorum-size>4</quorum-size>
  <quorum-listeners>
    <quorum-listener>com.company.quorum.FourMemberQuorumListener</quorum-listener>
  </quorum-listeners>
</quorum>

<map name="default">
  <quorum-ref>quorumRuleWithFourMembers</quorum-ref>
</map>
....
</hazelcast>
```

**Programmatic:**

```java
QuorumListenerConfig listenerConfig = new QuorumListenerConfig();
// You can either directly set quorum listener implementation of your own
listenerConfig.setImplementation(new QuorumListener() {
            @Override
            public void onChange(QuorumEvent quorumEvent) {
                if (quorumEvent.isPresent()) {
                       // handle quorum presence
                } else {
                    // handle quorum absence
                }
            }
        });
// Or you can give the name of the class that implements QuorumListener interface.
listenerConfig.setClassName("com.company.quorum.ThreeMemberQuorumListener");

QuorumConfig quorumConfig = new QuorumConfig();
quorumConfig.setName("quorumRuleWithFourMembers")
quorumConfig.setEnabled(true);
quorumConfig.setSize(4);
quorumConfig.addListenerConfig(listenerConfig);


MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig();
mapConfig.setQuorumName("quorumRuleWithFourMembers");

Config config = new Config();
config.addQuorumConfig(quorumConfig);
config.addMapConfig(mapConfig);
```




### Querying Quorum Results

Split Brain Protection Quorum service gives you the ability to query quorum results over the `Quorum` instances. Quorum instances let you query the result of a particular quorum.

Here is a Quorum interface that you can interact with.

```java
/**
 * {@link Quorum} provides access to the current status of a quorum.
 */
public interface Quorum {
    /**
     * Returns true if quorum is present, false if absent.
     *
     * @return boolean presence of the quorum
     */
    boolean isPresent();
}
```
You can retrieve the quorum instance for a particular quorum over the quorum service, as in the following example.

```java
String quorumName = "at-least-one-storage-member";
QuorumConfig quorumConfig = new QuorumConfig();
quorumConfig.setName(quorumName)
quorumConfig.setEnabled(true);

MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig();
mapConfig.setQuorumName(quorumName);

Config config = new Config();
config.addQuorumConfig(quorumConfig);
config.addMapConfig(mapConfig);

HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
QuorumService quorumService = hazelcastInstance.getQuorumService();
Quorum quorum = quorumService.getQuorum(quorumName);

boolean quorumPresence = quorum.isPresent();

```
