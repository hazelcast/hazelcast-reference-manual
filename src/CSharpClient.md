You can use the native .NET client to connect to Hazelcast client members. You need to add `HazelcastClient3x.dll` into your .NET project references. The API is very similar to the Java native client. 

Please refer to .NET client's own GitHub repo at <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-csharp-client" target="_blank">Hazelcast .NET Client</a> for information on configuring and starting the client.
