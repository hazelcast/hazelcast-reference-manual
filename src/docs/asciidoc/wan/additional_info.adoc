=== Event Filtering API

WAN replication allows you to intercept WAN replication events before they are placed to
WAN event replication queues by providing a filtering API.
Using this API, you can monitor WAN replication events of each data structure
separately.

You can attach filters to your data structures using the `filter` element of
`wan-replication-ref` configuration inside `hazelcast.xml` as shown below.
You can also configure it using the programmatic configuration.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="testMap">
        <wan-replication-ref name="test">
            <filters>
                <filter-impl>com.example.MyFilter</filter-impl>
                <filter-impl>com.example.MyFilter2</filter-impl>
            </filters>
        </wan-replication-ref>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

As shown in the above configuration, you can define more than one filter. Filters are called in the order that they are introduced.
A WAN replication event is only eligible to publish if it passes all the filters.

Map and Cache have different filter interfaces: `MapWanEventFilter` and
`CacheWanEventFilter`. Both of these interfaces have the method `filter` which takes the following parameters:

* `mapName`/`cacheName`: Name of the related data structure.
* `entryView`: link:{docBaseUrl}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/EntryView.html[EntryView^]
or link:{docBaseUrl}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/cache/CacheEntryView.html[CacheEntryView^] depending on the data structure.
* `eventType`: Enum type - `UPDATED(1)`, `REMOVED(2)` or `LOADED(3)` - depending on the event.

NOTE: `LOADED` events are filtered out and not replicated to target cluster.

=== Dynamically Adding WAN Publishers

When running clusters for an extensive period, you might need to
dynamically change the configuration while the cluster is running.
This includes dynamically adding new WAN replication publishers (new target clusters) and
replicating the subsequent map and cache updates to the new publishers without any manual intervention.

You can add new WAN publishers to an existing WAN replication using
almost all of the configuration options that are available when
configuring the WAN publishers in the static configuration (including using Discovery SPI).
The new configuration is not persisted but it is replicated to all existing and new members.
Once the cluster is completely restarted, the dynamically added publisher configuration is lost and
the updates are not replicated to the target cluster anymore until added again.

If you wish to preserve the new configuration over cluster restarts, you must add
the exact same configuration to the static configuration file after dynamically adding the publisher configuration to a running cluster.

You cannot remove the existing configurations but can put the publishers into
a STOPPED state which prevents the WAN events from being enqueued in the WAN queues and
prevents the replication, rendering the publisher idle. The configurations also cannot be changed.

Synchronization can be initiated through
link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#wan-sync[Management Center^] and
Hazelcastâ€™s REST API.

Below is the URL for the REST call:

```
http://member_ip:port/hazelcast/rest/wan/addWanConfig
```

You need to add the following URL-encoded parameters to the request in the following order separated by "&";

* Cluster name
* Cluster password
* WAN replication configuration, serialized as JSON

You can, at any point, even when maps and caches are concurrently mutated, add a new WAN publisher to
an existing WAN replication configuration.
The limitation is that there must be an existing WAN replication configuration but
it can be empty, without any publishers (target clusters).
For instance, this is an example of an XML configuration to which you can dynamically add new publishers:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <wan-replication name="wanReplication"></wan-replication>
    <map name="my-map">
        <wan-replication-ref name="wan-replication">
            <merge-policy>com.hazelcast.spi.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy</merge-policy>
            <republishing-enabled>false</republishing-enabled>
       </wan-replication-ref>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

Note that the map has defined WAN replication but there is no target cluster yet.
You can then add the new WAN replication publishers (target clusters) by
performing an HTTP POST as shown below:

```
curl -X POST -d "clusterName&clusterPassword&{...}" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/addWanConfig

```

You can provide the full configuration as JSON as a parameter.
Any WAN configuration supported in the XML and programmatic configurations is also supported in this JSON format.
Below are some examples of JSON configuration for a WAN publisher using
the Discovery SPI and static IP configuration. Here are the integer values for `initialPublisherState`,
`queueFullBehavior` and `consistencyCheckStrategy`:

* `initialPublisherState`:
** 0: REPLICATING
** 1: PAUSED
** 2: STOPPED
* `queueFullBehavior`:
** 0: DISCARD_AFTER_MUTATION
** 1: THROW_EXCEPTION
** 2: THROW_EXCEPTION_ONLY_IF_REPLICATION_ACTIVE
* `consistencyCheckStrategy`:
** 0: NONE
** 1: MERKLE_TREES


Below is an example using Discovery SPI (AWS configuration):

```
{
   "name":"wanReplication",
   "publishers":[
      {
         "clusterName":"tokyo",
         "queueCapacity":10000,
         "queueFullBehavior":0,
         "initialPublisherState":0,
         "discovery":{
            "nodeFilterClass":null,
            "discoveryStrategy":[
               {
                  "className":"com.hazelcast.aws.AwsDiscoveryStrategy",
                  "properties":{
                     "security-group-name":"hazelcast",
                     "tag-value":"cluster1",
                     "host-header":"ec2.amazonaws.com",
                     "tag-key":"aws-test-cluster",
                     "secret-key":"my-secret-key",
                     "iam-role":"s3access",
                     "access-key":"my-access-key",
                     "hz-port":"5701-5708",
                     "region":"us-west-1"
                  }
               }
            ]
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

Below is an example with Discovery SPI (the new AWS configuration)

```
{
   "name":"wanReplication",
   "publishers":[
      {
         "clusterName":"tokyo",
         "queueCapacity":1000,
         "queueFullBehavior":0,
         "initialPublisherState":0,
         "aws":{
            "enabled":true,
            "usePublicIp":false,
            "properties":{
               "security-group-name":"hazelcast-sg",
               "tag-value":"hz-nodes",
               "host-header":"ec2.amazonaws.com",
               "tag-key":"type",
               "secret-key":"my-secret-key",
               "iam-role":"dummy",
               "access-key":"my-access-key",
               "region":"us-west-1"
            }
         },
         "sync":{
            "consistencyCheckStrategy":0
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

Below is an example with static IP configuration (with some optional attributes):

```
{
   "name":"wanReplication",
   "publishers":[
      {
         "clusterName":"tokyo",
         "queueCapacity":1000,
         "queueFullBehavior":0,
         "initialPublisherState":0,
         "responseTimeoutMillis":5000,
         "targetEndpoints":"10.3.5.1:5701, 10.3.5.2:5701",
         "batchMaxDelayMillis":3000,
         "batchSize":50,
         "snapshotEnabled":false,
         "acknowledgeType":1,
         "sync":{
            "consistencyCheckStrategy":0
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

Below is an XML configuration with two publishers and several (disabled) discovery strategy configurations:

```
{
   "name":"wanReplication",
   "publishers":[
      {
         "clusterName":"tokyo",

=== WAN Replication Additional Information

Each cluster in WAN topology has to have a unique `cluster-name` property for a proper handling of forwarded events.

WAN replication backs up its event queues to other members to prevent event loss in case of member failures.
WAN replication's backup mechanism depends on the related data structures' backup operations. Note that, WAN replication is supported for IMap and ICache.
That means, as far as you set a backup count for your IMap or ICache instances, WAN replication events generated by these instances are also replicated.

There is no additional configuration to enable/disable WAN replication event backups.

[[wr-rest]]
=== REST API

NOTE: To be able to use the REST calls related to synchronization, you need to enable the
`WAN` REST endpoint group. See the <<using-the-rest-endpoint-groups, Using the REST Endpoint Groups section>> for details.

The two phases of the Merkle tree based synchronization can be triggered by a REST call, as it can be done with the
default synchronization.

The URL for the consistency check REST call:

```
http://member_ip:port/hazelcast/rest/wan/consistencyCheck/map
```

The URL for the synchronization REST call - the same as it is for the default synchronization:

```
http://member_ip:port/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map
```

You need to add URL-encoded parameters to the request in both cases in the following order separated by "&";

* Cluster name
* Cluster password
* Name of the WAN replication configuration
* WAN replication publisher ID/target cluster name
* Map name to be synchronized

NOTE: You can also use the following URL in your REST call if you want to synchronize all the maps in source and target cluster:
`+http://member_ip:port/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/allmaps+`. You need to add the following URL-encoded parameters to
the request in the following order separated by "&";

* Cluster name
* Cluster password
* Name of the WAN replication configuration
* WAN replication publisher ID/target cluster name

NOTE: Consistency check can be triggered only for one map.

[[wr-stats]]
=== Statistics

The consistency check and the synchronization both write statistics into the diagnostics subsystem and send it
 to the Management Center. The following reported fields can be used to reason about the efficiency of the configuration.

Consistency check reports the number of the:

* Merkle tree nodes checked
* Merkle tree nodes found to be different
* and entries needed to be synchronized to make the clusters consistent.

Synchronization reports the:

* duration of the synchronization
* number of the entries synchronized
* average number of the entries per tree leaves in the synchronized leaves.
