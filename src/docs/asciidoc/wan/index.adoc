== WAN Replication

[blue]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Feature*

=== Introduction

There could be cases where you need to synchronize multiple independent Hazelcast clusters to the same state
or if you would like to replicate map and cache updates to some other external system.
Hazelcast WAN Replication allows you to keep multiple Hazelcast clusters or other systems in sync by replicating
their states over WAN environments such as the Internet.

Imagine you have different data centers in New York, London and Tokyo each running
an independent Hazelcast cluster. Each cluster would be operating at native speed in their own LAN
(Local Area Network), but you also want some or all updates in these clusters to be replicated to
each other - updates in the Tokyo cluster should also replicate to London and New York and updates
in the New York cluster are to be synchronized to the Tokyo and London clusters.

WAN Replication also is able to provide much more control than the replication mechanism between members in a single
cluster with features and capabilities such as:

* WAN Replication will gracefully detect if there is a connectivity issue between clusters, buffering any updates
that are not yet replicated and will attempt to re-establish a connection to resume replication
* WAN Replication allows you to permanently pause, stop and resume replication. This is most useful when you know
that one of the clusters will be temporarily (e.g. upgrade) or permanently (removing a cluster out of service) unavailable.
* WAN Replication allows you to synchronize the contents of maps and caches
* WAN Replication allows you to dynamically add new target clusters without any restarts
And much more.

This section explains how you can replicate the state of your clusters over Wide Area Network (WAN)
through Hazelcast WAN Replication.

NOTE: To be able to use the REST calls related to WAN Replication mentioned in the following sections,
you need to enable the `WAN` REST endpoint group.
See the <<using-the-rest-endpoint-groups, Using the REST Endpoint Groups section>> for details.
