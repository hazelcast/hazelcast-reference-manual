=== Statistics

The consistency check and the synchronization both write statistics into the diagnostics subsystem and send it
 to the Management Center. The following reported fields can be used to reason about the efficiency of the configuration.

Consistency check reports the number of the:

* Merkle tree nodes checked
* Merkle tree nodes found to be different
* and entries needed to be synchronized to make the clusters consistent.

Synchronization reports the:

* duration of the synchronization
* number of the entries synchronized
* average number of the entries per tree leaves in the synchronized leaves.
