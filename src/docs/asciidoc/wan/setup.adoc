=== Defining WAN Replication

There are two different ways of defining WAN replication endpoints.

* Static endpoints: this is most suitable when the endpoints have static IP addresses which will not change for
the duration of the lifecycle of the source cluster. You will then list these addresses in the WAN publisher
configuration and WAN Replication will try to keep a stable connection to each of those.
See the <<wanbatchreplication-static-endpoints, Defining WAN Replication Using Static Endpoints>> section for more details.
* Discovery SPI: this is most suitable when you don't know the list of static IP addresses of the target cluster at
startup time or in cases when the list of available target endpoints is subject to change during the lifecycle of the
source cluster. With the discovery SPI, you can store the list of IP addresses in an external system and you can use
one of our own discovery SPI implementations to read from some of these external systems (e.g. AWS, Eureka, ...). You
can even write your own discovery SPI implementation which will be adapted to your use case. For instance, you can keep
the list of target IP addresses in a file on disk and WAN Replication will periodically invoke your SPI implementation
to read that file and return the updated list.
See the <<wanbatchreplication-discovery-spi, Defining WAN Replication Using Discovery SPI>> section for more details.

You can use at most one of these when defining a single WAN publisher. Let's first start off with a basic template
for WAN Replication configuration that's shared between the two ways. This example is thus incomplete but shows
similarities between the two ways of configuring WAN replication. Please refer to the subsequent sections on how to
fully configure WAN Replication.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<hazelcast>
    <wan-replication name="london-wan-rep">
        <batch-publisher>
            <cluster-name>london</cluster-name>
            ...
        </batch-publisher>
    </wan-replication>

    <map name="replicatedMap">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
    </map>

    <cache name="replicatedCache">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
    </cache>
</hazelcast>
----

Above, you notice that we have configured the instance to replicate a map and a cache to a target cluster
with the cluster name `london`. WAN Replication will check that this cluster name matches during connection
establishment to each endpoint. This does not serve as a security measure though. This serves only to prevent
misconfiguration where the source cluster would mistakenly replicate to the wrong cluster and as an attempt to
detect and prevent loops where the same WAN event would be infinitely forwarded between the same clusters.

The `wan-replication` configuration element defines a single WAN replication scheme. Hazelcast maps and caches
are configured to replicate to a single WAN replication scheme and different maps and different caches can be
configured to replicate to different WAN replication schemes. Simply put, a WAN replication scheme may be viewed
as several target clusters and different Hazelcast structures can replicate to different target clusters
simultaneously. As such, a single WAN replication scheme can contain multiple WAN replication publishers.
It has the following essential sub-elements and attributes:

* `name`: Name of your WAN replication scheme. This name is referenced in IMap or ICache configuration when you want
to enable WAN Replication for these data structures (using the element `wan-replication-ref` in the configuration
of IMap or ICache).
* `batch-publisher`: Enables use of a WAN publisher which uses the built-in WAN replication implementation in the
Hazelcast Enterprise Edition. See the <<wanbatchreplication-implementation, WAN Batch Publisher Implementation>> section
for more information. It defines how to connect to the target cluster and how WAN events are sent to a specific target
endpoint. As mentioned above, just before the configuration example, the target endpoints can be a different cluster
defined by static IPs or discovered using a cloud discovery mechanism.

The `batch-publisher` element is used to configure the built-in WAN replication implementation in the
Hazelcast Enterprise Edition. It has the following sub-elements:

* `cluster-name`: Sets the cluster name used as an endpoint cluster name for authentication
on the target endpoint. If there is no separate publisher ID element defined, this cluster name
is also used as a WAN publisher ID. This ID is then used for identifying the publisher in a
WAN replication scheme. It is mandatory to set this attribute.
* `publisher-id`: Sets the publisher ID used to identify the publisher in a WAN replication scheme.
Setting this ID may be useful when the `wan-replication` element contains multiple WAN publishers and the
cluster names are not unique for all of the WAN replication publishers in a single WAN replication scheme.
It is optional to set this attribute. If this ID is not specified, the `cluster-name` is used as a publisher ID.
* `target-endpoints`: IP addresses and ports of the cluster members for which the WAN replication is implemented.
It is enough to specify some of the member IP/ports available in the target cluster, i.e., you donâ€™t need to
provide the IP/ports of all members in there. WAN does not perform the discovery of other members in the target cluster;
it only expects that the IP addresses you provide are available.
* `sync`: Configuration for the WAN sync mechanism.
* `aws`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Amazon EC2 discovery plugin.
* `gcp`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Google cloud platform discovery plugin.
* `azure`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Microsoft Azure discovery plugin.
* `kubernetes`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Kubernetes discovery plugin.
* `eureka`: Configuration for discovery strategy for Eureka discovery plugin.
* `discovery-strategies`: Set its `enabled` attribute to true for discovery in various cloud infrastructures.
You can define multiple discovery strategies using the `discovery-strategy` sub-element and its elements.

Using this configuration, the cluster replicates to a cluster with the name `london`.
The `london` cluster should have a similar configuration if you want to run in Active-Active mode.

You can achieve various WAN topologies using different configurations on different clusters. For instance,
if the New York and London cluster configurations contain the `wan-replication` element and the Tokyo cluster
does not, it might mean that the New York and London clusters are active endpoints and Tokyo is a passive endpoint.

[[wanbatchreplication-static-endpoints]]
==== Using Static Endpoints

Below is an example of declarative configuration of WAN Replication between two Hazelcast clusters. Here, we show the
configuration that is needed on the source ("active") cluster. In most cases, the target ("passive") cluster does not
need any kind of configuration and configuring the source cluster is enough for WAN Replication to function normally.

Here, we show the simplest working XML configuration to replicate to a target cluster with the cluster-name `london`.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <wan-replication name="london-wan-rep">
        <batch-publisher>
            <cluster-name>london</cluster-name>
            <target-endpoints>10.3.5.1:5701, 10.3.5.2:5701</target-endpoints>
        </batch-publisher>
    </wan-replication>

    <map name="replicatedMap">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
        ...
    </map>

    <cache name="replicatedCache">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
        ...
    </cache>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

We can see that we have configured the map named `replicatedMap` and cache named `replicatedCache` to
replicate to the cluster named `london` on two endpoints - `10.3.5.1:5701, 10.3.5.2:5701`. The `london` cluster
might have more members than these two but only these two will receive WAN events and forward them to other
members in the `london` cluster or to other clusters if WAN event forwarding is enabled.
Please notice that the WAN Replication configuration is referenced in map and cache configuration by name, here
`london-wan-rep`.

And the following is the equivalent programmatic configuration snippet:

[source,java]

include::{javasource}/wan/ExampleWANReplicationConfiguration.java[tag=wrc]

The default settings for WAN Replication will suit most use cases. If, however, you have specific needs or if you
would like to fine-tune the behavior of WAN Replication for your application, please refer to the
<<tuning-wr, Tuning WAN Replication>> section for more information.

[[wanbatchreplication-discovery-spi]]
==== Using Discovery SPI

In addition to defining target cluster endpoints with static IP addresses,
you can configure WAN to work with the discovery SPI and determine the endpoint IP addresses at runtime.
This allows you to use WAN with endpoints on various cloud infrastructures (such as Amazon EC2 or GCP Compute) where
the IP address is not known in advance. Typically you use a readily available discovery SPI plugin such as
link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws[Hazelcast AWS EC2 discovery plugin^],
link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-gcp[Hazelcast GCP discovery plugin^], or similar.
For more advanced cases, you can provide your own discovery SPI implementation with custom logic for
determining the WAN target endpoints such as looking up the endpoints in some service registry or even
reading the endpoint addresses from a file.

NOTE: When using the discovery SPI, WAN always connects to the public address of the members returned by
the discovery SPI implementation. This is opposite to the cluster membership mechanism using
the discovery SPI where a member connects to a different member in the same cluster through its private address.
Should you prefer for WAN to use the private address of the discovered member as well,
please use the `use-endpoint-private-address` publisher element (see below).

Following is an example of setting up the WAN replication with the EC2 discovery plugin.
You must have the link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws[Hazelcast AWS EC2 discovery plugin^] on the classpath.

        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
        ...
    </cache>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The `hz-port` property defines the port or the port range on which the target endpoint is running.
The default port range 5701-5708 is used if this property is not defined.
This is needed because the Amazon API which the AWS plugin uses does not provide
the port on which Hazelcast is running, only the IP address. For some other discovery SPI implementations,
this might not be necessary and it might discover the port as well, e.g., by looking up in a service registry.

The other properties are the same as when using the `aws` element. In case of EC2 discovery you can configure
the WAN replication using the `aws` element. You may use either of these, but not both at the same time.

The default settings for WAN Replication will suit most use cases. If, however, you have specific needs or if you
would like to fine-tune the behavior of WAN Replication for your application, please refer to the
<<tuning-wr, Tuning WAN Replication>> section for more information.

[[configuring-wan-replication-for-imap-and-icache]]
==== Configuring for IMap and ICache

You can configure WAN replication for Hazelcast's IMap and ICache data structures.
To enable WAN replication for an IMap or ICache instance, you can use the `wan-replication-ref` element.
Each IMap and ICache instance can have a different WAN replication configuration.

**Enabling WAN Replication for IMap:**

Imagine you have different distributed maps, however only one of those maps should be replicated to a target cluster.
To achieve this, configure the map that you want to be replicated by adding the `wan-replication-ref` element in
the map configuration as shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <wan-replication name="london-wan-rep">
        ...
    </wan-replication>
    <map name="my-shared-map">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep">
            <merge-policy>com.hazelcast.spi.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy</merge-policy>
            <republishing-enabled>false</republishing-enabled>
        </wan-replication-ref>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The following is the equivalent programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/wan/EnablingWRforMap.java[tag=wrmap]
----

You see that we have `my-shared-map` configured to replicate itself to the cluster targets defined in the earlier
`wan-replication` element.

`wan-replication-ref` has the following elements;

* `name`: Name of `wan-replication` configuration. IMap or ICache instance uses this `wan-replication` configuration.
* `merge-policy`: Resolve conflicts that occur when the target cluster already has the replicated entry key.
This configuration element is optional. If it is not specified, `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy`
will be used as the merge policy.
* `republishing-enabled`: When enabled, an incoming event to a member is forwarded to target cluster of that member.
Enabling the event republishing is useful in a scenario where cluster A replicates to cluster B and
cluster B replicates to cluster C. You do not need to enable republishing when all your clusters
replicate to each other.

When using Active-Active Replication, multiple clusters can simultaneously update the same
entry in a distributed data structure. You can configure a merge policy to resolve these potential
conflicts, as shown in the above example configuration (using the `merge-policy` sub-element under
the `wan-replication-ref` element).

Hazelcast provides the following merge policies for IMap:

* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.PutIfAbsentMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to
the target map if it does not exist in the target map.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.HigherHitsMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to
the target map if the source entry has more hits than the target one.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to
the target map unless the incoming entry is not null.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.ExpirationTimeMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to
the target map if the source entry will expire later than the destination entry.
Please note that this merge policy can only be used when the clusters' clocks are in sync.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.LatestAccessMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to
the target map if the source entry has been accessed more recently than the destination entry.
Please note that this merge policy can only be used when the clusters' clocks are in sync.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.LatestUpdateMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source map to
the target map if the source entry has been updated more recently than the target entry.
Please note that this merge policy can only be used when the clusters' clocks are in sync.

NOTE: When using WAN replication, please note that only key based events are replicated to the target cluster.
Operations like `clear`, `destroy`, `evict` and `evictAll` are NOT replicated.

**Enabling WAN Replication for ICache:**

The following is a declarative configuration example for enabling WAN Replication for ICache:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <wan-replication name="london-wan-rep">
        ...
    </wan-replication>
    <cache name="my-shared-cache">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep">
            <merge-policy>com.hazelcast.spi.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy</merge-policy>
            <republishing-enabled>true</republishing-enabled>
        </wan-replication-ref>
    </cache>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

The following is the equivalent programmatic configuration:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/wan/EnablingWRforCache.java[tag=wrcache]
----

NOTE: Caches that are created dynamically do not support WAN replication functionality.
Cache configurations should be defined either declaratively (by XML) or programmatically on both
source and target clusters.

Hazelcast provides the following merge policies for ICache:

* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.PutIfAbsentMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source cache to
the target cache if it does not exist in the target cache.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.HigherHitsMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source cache to
the target cache if the source entry has more hits than the target one.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source cache to
the target cache unless the incoming entry is not null.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.ExpirationTimeMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source cache to
the target cache if the source entry will expire later than the destination entry.
Please note that this merge policy can only be used when the clusters' clocks are in sync.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.LatestAccessMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source cache to
the target cache if the source entry has been accessed more recently than the destination entry.
Please note that this merge policy can only be used when the clusters' clocks are in sync.
* `com.hazelcast.spi.merge.LatestUpdateMergePolicy`: Incoming entry merges from the source cache to
the target cache if the source entry has been updated more recently than the target entry.
Please note that this merge policy can only be used when the clusters' clocks are in sync.

==== Customizing WAN Event Processing on Passive/Target Cluster

In addition to customizing behavior of the source cluster and how WAN events are sent and retained, you can also
configure some aspects of how WAN events are processed on the receiving (target/passive) cluster. In addition, you
can also define a custom implementation of a WAN event consumer. A custom WAN consumer allows you to define custom
processing logic and is usually used in combination with a custom WAN publisher. A custom consumer is optional and
you may simply omit defining it which causes the default processing logic to be used. We will not describe custom
WAN replication here in detail. Please refer to the
<<defining-custom-wr, Defining custom WAN Replication>> section for more information.

Below you can see an example configuration of the target/passive cluster where we configure how incoming WAN events
are processed.

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...

    <wan-replication name="london-wan-rep">
        <consumer>
            <persist-wan-replicated-data>false</persist-wan-replicated-data>
        </consumer>
    </wan-replication>

    <map name="replicatedMap">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
        ...
    </map>

    <cache name="replicatedCache">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
        ...
    </cache>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

In the configuration above you can see that the WAN Replication configuration is again matched by WAN replication
scheme name to the exact map and cache configuration. This means that different structures can process WAN events
differently.

The processing behavior is configured using the `consumer` element. It has the following sub-elements:

* `persist-wan-replicated-data`: When set to `true`, an incoming event over WAN replication can be
persisted to a database for example, otherwise it is not persisted. Default value is `true`.
