=== REST API Wrap-Up

NOTE: To be able to use the REST calls related to WAN Replication
mentioned in this section, you need to enable the `WAN` REST endpoint group.
See the <<using-the-rest-endpoint-groups, Using the REST Endpoint Groups section>> on
how to enable it.

==== Parameters

Here is the list of parameters used in the WAN Replication REST calls, which
are shown as placeholders in the REST calls:

* member IP address and port: IP address and port number of the
member on which you run the REST calls.
* `clusterOnSource`: Name of your local (source) cluster.
* `clusterPassword`: Password, if set, of your source cluster.
Note that you need to enable the <<enabling-jaas-security, security>>
when you need a cluster password. If not set, the parameter is empty.
* `wanRepName`: Name of the WAN Replication configuration.
* `publisherId`: WAN replication publisher ID. If not set,
`cluster-name` under the `batch-publisher` element is used.
* `mapName`: Name of the map to be synchronized.
* `wanConfig`: WAN publisher configuration file, as a JSON string,
to be added dynamically.

The parameters in the below curl commands need to be provided
in the given order, separated by `&`.

Let's use the following declarative configuration as the example to
be used in the curl commands described in the sections below, and
let's assume that our source cluster does not have a password:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <cluster-name>tokyo</cluster-name>
    <wan-replication name="london-wan-rep">
        <batch-publisher>
            <cluster-name>london</cluster-name>
            <target-endpoints>10.3.5.1:5701, 10.3.5.2:5701</target-endpoints>
        </batch-publisher>
    </wan-replication>

    <map name="myMap">
        <wan-replication-ref name="london-wan-rep"/>
    </map>
</hazelcast>
----


==== Clearing the Queues

The URL for cleaning the WAN event queues is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/clearWanQueues
```

The following is the curl command: 

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusteronSourceName}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/clearWanQueues
```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows:

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/clearWanQueues
```


==== Pausing the Publisher

The URL for pausing the WAN publisher is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/pausePublisher
```

The following is the curl command: 

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/pausePublisher
```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows:

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/pausePublisher
```

==== Resuming the Publisher

The URL for resuming the WAN publisher is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/resumePublisher
```

The following is the curl command: 

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/resumePublisher
```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows:

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/resumePublisher
```


==== Stopping the Publisher

The URL for stopping the WAN publisher is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/stopPublisher
```

The following is the curl command: 

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/stopPublisher
```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows:

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/stopPublisher
```

==== Synchronizing the Clusters

For the full synchronization, the URLs for synchronizing a single map and all maps are as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/allMaps
```

The following are the respective curl commands:

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}&{mapName}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map

curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/allMaps

```

The command according to the above example configuration is as follows (for that single map):

```
curl -X POST -d "tokyo&&london-wan-rep&london&myMap" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/sync/map
```


For the delta synchronization, you need to first perform a
consistency check, using the the following REST call URL:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/consistencyCheck/map
```

Here is the respective curl command:

```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanRepName}&{publisherId}&{mapName}" --URL http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/consistencyCheck/map
```

After the consistency check, you can use the same REST calls
used in full synchronization in the same way to synchronize
a single map or all the maps.


NOTE: Consistency check can be triggered only for one map.

[[wr-dynamically-adding]]
==== Dynamically Adding WAN Publishers

The URL for dynamically adding a WAN publisher configuration is as follows:

```
http://{member IP address:port}/hazelcast/rest/wan/addWanConfig
```

The following is the curl command: 


```
curl -X POST -d "{clusterOnSource}&{clusterPassword}&{wanConfig}" --URL http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/wan/addWanConfig
```

The `wanConfig` parameter should be the full configuration as a JSON string.
See <<dynamically-adding-wan-publishers, here>> for configuration examples.
