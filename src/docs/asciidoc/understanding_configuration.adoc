== Understanding Configuration

This chapter describes the options to configure your Hazelcast applications and explains the utilities which you can make use of while configuring. You can configure Hazelcast using one or mix of the following options:

* Declarative way
* Programmatic way
* Using Hazelcast system properties
* Within the Spring context
* Dynamically adding configuration on a running cluster (starting with Hazelcast 3.9)

[[configuring-declaratively]]
=== Configuring Declaratively

This is the configuration option where you use an XML configuration file. When you download and unzip `hazelcast-<version>.zip`, you will see the following files present in `/bin` folder, which are standard XML-formatted configuration files:

* `hazelcast.xml`: Default declarative configuration file for Hazelcast. The configuration in this XML file should be fine for most of the Hazelcast users. If not, you can tailor this XML file according to your needs by adding/removing/modifying properties.
* `hazelcast-full-example.xml`: Configuration file which includes all Hazelcast configuration elements and attributes with their descriptions. It is the "superset" of `hazelcast.xml`. You can use `hazelcast-full-example.xml` as a reference document to learn about any element or attribute, or you can change its name to `hazelcast.xml` and start to use it as your Hazelcast configuration file.

A part of `hazelcast.xml` is shown as an example below.

[source,xml]
----
<group>
    <name>dev</name>
</group>
<management-center enabled="false">http://localhost:8080/mancenter</management-center>
<network>
     <port auto-increment="true" port-count="100">5701</port>
     <outbound-ports>
     <!--
     Allowed port range when connecting to other members.
     0 or * means the port provided by the system.
     -->
         <ports>0</ports>
     </outbound-ports>
     <join>
         <multicast enabled="true">
	     <multicast-group>224.2.2.3</multicast-group>
	     <multicast-port>54327</multicast-port>
	 </multicast>
	 <tcp-ip enabled="false">
	     <interface>127.0.0.1</interface>
	     <member-list>
	         <member>127.0.0.1</member>
	     </member-list>
	 </tcp-ip>
    </join>
</network>
<map name="default">
    <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>
</map>

[[composing-declarative-configuration]]
==== Composing Declarative Configuration

You can compose the declarative configuration of your Hazelcast member or Hazelcast client from multiple declarative configuration snippets. In order to compose a declarative configuration, you can use the `<import/>` element to load different declarative configuration files.

Let's say you want to compose the declarative configuration for Hazelcast out of two configurations: `development-group-config.xml` and `development-network-config.xml`. These two configurations are shown below.

`development-group-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <group>
      <name>dev</name>
  </group>
</hazelcast>
----

`development-network-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <network>
    <port auto-increment="true" port-count="100">5701</port>
    <join>
        <multicast enabled="true">
            <multicast-group>224.2.2.3</multicast-group>
            <multicast-port>54327</multicast-port>
        </multicast>
    </join>
  </network>
</hazelcast>
----

To get your example Hazelcast declarative configuration out of the above two, use the `<import/>` element as shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <import resource="development-group-config.xml"/>
  <import resource="development-network-config.xml"/>
</hazelcast>
----

This feature also applies to the declarative configuration of Hazelcast client. Please see the following examples.


`client-group-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
  <group>
      <name>dev</name>
  </group>
</hazelcast-client>
----

`client-network-config.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    <network>
        <cluster-members>
            <address>127.0.0.1:7000</address>
        </cluster-members>
    </network>
</hazelcast-client>
----

To get a Hazelcast client declarative configuration from the above two examples, use the `<import/>` element as shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
  <import resource="client-group-config.xml"/>
  <import resource="client-network-config.xml"/>
</hazelcast>
----

NOTE: Use `<import/>` element on top level of the XML hierarchy.

Using the element `<import>`, you can also load XML resources from classpath and file system:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <import resource="file:///etc/hazelcast/development-group-config.xml"/> <!-- loaded from filesystem -->
  <import resource="classpath:development-network-config.xml"/>  <!-- loaded from classpath -->
</hazelcast>
----

The element `<import>` supports variables too. Please see the following example snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <import resource="${environment}-group-config.xml"/>
  <import resource="${environment}-network-config.xml"/>
</hazelcast>
----

NOTE: You can refer to the <<using-variables, Using Variables section>> to learn how you can set the configuration elements with variables.

[[configuring-programmatically]]
=== Configuring Programmatically

Besides declarative configuration, you can configure your cluster programmatically. For this you can create a `Config` object, set/change its properties and attributes and use this `Config` object to create a new Hazelcast member. Following is an example code which configures some network and Hazelcast Map properties.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/ProgrammaticConfSample.java[tag=pcs]
----

To create a Hazelcast member with the above example configuration, pass the configuration object as shown below:

```
HazelcastInstance hazelcast = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );
```

NOTE: The `Config` must not be modified after the Hazelcast instance is started. In other words, all configuration must be completed before creating the `HazelcastInstance`. Certain additional configuration elements can be added at runtime as described in the <<dynamically-adding-data-structure-configuration-on-a-cluster, Dynamically Adding Data Structure Configuration on a Cluster section>>.

You can also create a named Hazelcast member. In this case, you should set `instanceName` of `Config` object as shown below:

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.setInstanceName( "my-instance" );
Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );
----

To retrieve an existing Hazelcast member by its name, use the following:

```
Hazelcast.getHazelcastInstanceByName( "my-instance" );
```

To retrieve all existing Hazelcast members, use the following:

```
Hazelcast.getAllHazelcastInstances();
```

NOTE: Hazelcast performs schema validation through the file `hazelcast-config-<version>.xsd` which comes with your Hazelcast libraries. Hazelcast throws a meaningful exception if there is an error in the declarative or programmatic configuration.


If you want to specify your own configuration file to create `Config`, Hazelcast supports several ways including filesystem, classpath, InputStream and URL:

* `Config cfg = new XmlConfigBuilder(xmlFileName).build();`
* `Config cfg = new XmlConfigBuilder(inputStream).build();`
* `Config cfg = new ClasspathXmlConfig(xmlFileName);`
* `Config cfg = new FileSystemXmlConfig(configFilename);`
* `Config cfg = new UrlXmlConfig(url);`
* `Config cfg = new InMemoryXmlConfig(xml);`

[[configuring-with-system-properties]]
=== Configuring with System Properties

You can use system properties to configure some aspects of Hazelcast. You set these properties as name and value pairs through declarative configuration, programmatic configuration or JVM system property. Following are examples for each option.

**Declaratively:**

[source,xml]
----
  ....
  <properties>
    <property name="hazelcast.property.foo">value</property>
    ....
  </properties>
</hazelcast>
----

**Programmatically:**

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config() ;
config.setProperty( "hazelcast.property.foo", "value" );
----

**Using JVM's `System` class or `-D` argument:**

`System.setProperty( "hazelcast.property.foo", "value" );`

or

`java -Dhazelcast.property.foo=value`

You will see Hazelcast system properties mentioned throughout this Reference Manual as required in some of the chapters and sections. All Hazelcast system properties are listed in the <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>> with their descriptions, default values and property types as a reference for you.

[[configuring-within-spring-context]]
=== Configuring within Spring Context

If you use Hazelcast with https://spring.io/[Spring] you can declare beans using the namespace `hazelcast`. When you add the namespace declaration to the element `beans` in the Spring context file, you can start to use the namespace shortcut `hz` to be used as a bean declaration. Following is an example Hazelcast configuration when integrated with Spring:

[source,xml]
----
<hz:hazelcast id="instance">
  <hz:config>
    <hz:group name="dev"/>
    <hz:network port="5701" port-auto-increment="false">
      <hz:join>
        <hz:multicast enabled="false"/>
        <hz:tcp-ip enabled="true">
          <hz:members>10.10.1.2, 10.10.1.3</hz:members>
        </hz:tcp-ip>
      </hz:join>
    </hz:network>
  </hz:config>
</hz:hazelcast>
----

Please see the <<integration-with-spring, Integration with Spring section>> for more information on Hazelcast-Spring integration.

[[dynamically-adding-data-structure-configuration-on-a-cluster]]
=== Dynamically Adding Data Structure Configuration on a Cluster

As described above, Hazelcast can be configured in a declarative or programmatic way; configuration must be completed before starting a Hazelcast member and this configuration cannot be altered at runtime, thus we refer to this as _static_ configuration.

Starting with Hazelcast 3.9, it is possible to dynamically add configuration for certain data structures at runtime; these can be added by invoking one of the `Config.add*Config` methods on the `Config` object obtained from a running member's `HazelcastInstance.getConfig()` method. For example:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/DynamicConfiguration.java[tag=dynconf]
----

Dynamic configuration elements must be fully configured before the invocation of `add*Config` method: at that point, the configuration object will be delivered to every member of the cluster and added to each member's dynamic configuration, so mutating the configuration object after the `add*Config` invocation will have no effect.

As dynamically added data structure configuration is propagated across all cluster members, failures may occur due to conditions such as timeout and network partition. The configuration propagation mechanism internally retries adding the configuration whenever a membership change is detected. However if an exception is thrown from `add*Config` method, the configuration may have been partially propagated to some cluster members and adding the configuration should be retried by the user.

Adding new dynamic configuration is supported for all `add*Config` methods except:

* `JobTracker` which has been deprecated since Hazelcast 3.8
* `QuorumConfig`: new quorum configuration cannot be dynamically added but other configuration can reference quorums configured in the existing static configuration
* `WanReplicationConfig`: new WAN replication configuration cannot be dynamically added, however existing static ones can be referenced from other configurations, e.g., a new dynamic `MapConfig` may include a `WanReplicationRef` to a statically configured WAN replication config.
* `ListenerConfig`: listeners can be instead added at runtime via other API such as `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().addMembershipListener` and `HazelcastInstance.getPartitionService().addMigrationListener`.

[[handling-configuration-conflicts]]
==== Handling Configuration Conflicts

Attempting to add a dynamic configuration, when a static configuration for the same element already exists, will throw `ConfigurationException`. For example, assuming we start a member with the following fragment in `hazelcast.xml` configuration:

```
  <map name="sessions">
     ...
  </map>
```

Then adding a dynamic configuration for a map with the name `sessions` will throw a `ConfigurationException`:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

MapConfig sessionsMapConfig = new MapConfig("sessions");

// this will throw ConfigurationException:
instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(sessionsMapConfig);
----

When attempting to add dynamic configuration for an element for which dynamic configuration has already been added, then if a configuration conflict is detected a `ConfigurationException` will be thrown. For example:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

MapConfig sessionsMapConfig = new MapConfig("sessions").setBackupCount(0);
instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(sessionsMapConfig);

MapConfig sessionsWithBackup = new MapConfig("sessions").setBackupCount(1);
// throws ConfigurationException because the new MapConfig conflicts with existing one
instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(sessionsWithBackup);

MapConfig sessionsWithoutBackup = new MapConfig("sessions").setBackupCount(0);
// does not throw exception: new dynamic config is equal to existing dynamic config of same name
instance.getConfig().addMapConfig(sessionsWithoutBackup);
----

[[checking-configuration]]
=== Checking Configuration

When you start a Hazelcast member without passing a `Config` object, as explained in the <<configuring-programmatically, Configuring Programmatically section>>, Hazelcast checks the member's configuration as follows:

* First, it looks for the `hazelcast.config` system property. If it is set, its value is used as the path. This is useful if you want to be able to change your Hazelcast configuration; you can do this because it is not embedded within the application. You can set the `config` option with the following command:
+
```
-Dhazelcast.config=`*`<path to the hazelcast.xml>
```
+
The path can be a regular one or a classpath reference with the prefix `classpath:`.
* If the above system property is not set, Hazelcast then checks whether there is a `hazelcast.xml` file in the working directory.
* If not, it then checks whether `hazelcast.xml` exists on the classpath.
* If none of the above works, Hazelcast loads the default configuration (`hazelcast.xml`) that comes with your Hazelcast package.

Before configuring Hazelcast, please try to work with the default configuration to see if it works for you. This default configuration should be fine for most of the users. If not, you can consider to modify the configuration to be more suitable for your environment.

[[configuration-pattern-matcher]]
=== Configuration Pattern Matcher

You can give a custom strategy to match an item name to a configuration pattern. By default Hazelcast uses a simplified wildcard matching. See <<using-wildcards, Using Wildcards section>> for this.
A custom configuration pattern matcher can be given by using either member or client `config` objects, as shown below:

[source,java]
----
// Setting a custom config pattern matcher via member config object
Config config = new Config();
config.setConfigPatternMatcher(new ExampleConfigPatternMatcher());
----

And the following is an example pattern matcher:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/ExampleConfigPatternMatcher.java[tag=patternmatcher]
----


[[using-wildcards]]
=== Using Wildcards

Hazelcast supports wildcard configuration for all distributed data structures that can be configured using `Config`, that is, for all except `IAtomicLong`, `IAtomicReference`. Using an asterisk (*) character in the name, different instances of maps, queues, topics, semaphores, etc. can be configured by a single configuration.

A single asterisk (*) can be placed anywhere inside the configuration name.

For instance, a map named `com.hazelcast.test.mymap` can be configured using one of the following configurations.

```xml
<map name="com.hazelcast.test.*">
...
</map>
```

```xml
<map name="com.hazel*">
...
</map>
```

```xml
<map name="*.test.mymap">
...
</map>
```

```xml
<map name="com.*test.mymap">
...
</map>
```

Or a queue `com.hazelcast.test.myqueue`:

```xml
<queue name="*hazelcast.test.myqueue">
...
</queue>
```

```xml
<queue name="com.hazelcast.*.myqueue">
...
</queue>
```

[NOTE]
====

* You can use only a single asterisk as a wildcard for each data structure configuration.
* If you have matching wildcard configurations for a data structure, the more specific (longest) one is used when configuring it. Let's say you have a map named `mymap.customer.name` and you have map configurations `mymap.\*` and `mymap.customer.*`. Hazelcast uses `mymap.customer.*` to configure this map.
====

[[using-variables]]
=== Using Variables

In your Hazelcast and/or Hazelcast Client declarative configuration, you can use variables to set the values of the elements. This is valid when you set a system property programmatically or you use the command line interface. You can use a variable in the declarative configuration to access the values of the system properties you set.

For example, see the following command that sets two system properties.

```
-Dgroup.name=dev
```

Let's get the values of these system properties in the declarative configuration of Hazelcast, as shown below.

```xml
<hazelcast>
  <group>
    <name>${group.name}</name>
  </group>
</hazelcast>
```

This also applies to the declarative configuration of Hazelcast Client, as shown below.

```xml
<hazelcast-client>
  <group>
    <name>${group.name}</name>
  </group>
</hazelcast-client>
```

If you do not want to rely on the system properties, you can use the `XmlConfigBuilder` and explicitly set a `Properties` instance, as shown below.

[source,java]
----
Properties properties = new Properties();

// fill the properties, e.g., from database/LDAP, etc.

XmlConfigBuilder builder = new XmlConfigBuilder();
builder.setProperties(properties);
Config config = builder.build();
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
----


[[variable-replacers]]
=== Variable Replacers

Variable replacers are used to replace custom strings during loading the configuration, e.g., they can be used to mask sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. Of course their usage is not limited to security related information.

Variable replacers implement the interface `com.hazelcast.config.replacer.spi.ConfigReplacer` and they are configured only declaratively: in the Hazelcast's declarative configuration files, i.e., `hazelcast.xml` and `hazelcast-client.xml`. You can refer to `ConfigReplacer` s https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/replacer/spi/ConfigReplacer.html[Javadoc] for basic information on how a replacer works.

Variable replacers are configured within the element `<config-replacers>` under `<hazelcast>`, as shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <config-replacers fail-if-value-missing="false">
        <replacer class-name="com.acme.MyReplacer">
            <properties>
                <property name="propName">value</property>
                ...
            </properties>
        </replacer>
        <replacer class-name="example.AnotherReplacer"/>
    </config-replacers>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----

As you can see, `<config-replacers>` is the parent element for your replacers, which are declared using the `<replacer>` sub-elements. You can define multiple replacers under the `<config-replacers>.` Here are the descriptions of elements and attributes used for the replacer configuration:

* `fail-if-value-missing`: Specifies whether the loading configuration process stops when a replacement value is missing. It is an optional attribute and its default value is true.
* `class-name`: Full class name of the replacer.
* `<properties>`: Contains names and values of the properties used to configure a replacer. Each property is defined using the `<property>` sub-element. All of the properties are explained in the upcoming sections.

The following replacer classes are provided by Hazelcast as example implementations of the `ConfigReplacer` interface. Note that you can also implement your own replacers.

* `EncryptionReplacer`
* `PropertyReplacer`

NOTE: There is also a `ExecReplacer` which runs an external command and uses its standard output as the value for the variable. Please refer to its https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/blob/master/variable-replacers/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/sample/replacer/ExecReplacer.java[code sample].


Each example replacer is explained in the below sections.

==== EncryptionReplacer

This example `EncryptionReplacer` replaces encrypted variables by its plain form. The secret key for encryption/decryption is generated from a password which can be a value in a file and/or environment specific values, such as MAC address and actual user data.

Its full class name is `com.hazelcast.config.replacer.EncryptionReplacer` and the replacer prefix is `ENC`. Here are the properties used to configure this example replacer:

* `cipherAlgorithm`: Cipher algorithm used for the encryption/decryption. Its default value is AES.
* `keyLengthBits`: Length of the secret key to be generated in bits. Its default value is 128 bits.
* `passwordFile`: Path to a file whose content should be used as a part of the encryption password. When the property is not provided no file is used as a part of the password. Its default value is null.
* `passwordNetworkInterface`: Name of network interface whose MAC address should be used as a part of the encryption password. When the property is not provided no network interface property is used as a part of the password. Its default value is null.
* `passwordUserProperties`: Specifies whether the current user properties (`user.name` and `user.home`) should be used as a part of the encryption password. Its default value is true.
* `saltLengthBytes`: Length of a random password salt in bytes. Its default value is 8 bytes.
* `secretKeyAlgorithm`:  Name of the secret-key algorithm to be associated with the generated secret key. Its default value is AES.
* `secretKeyFactoryAlgorithm`: Algorithm used to generate a secret key from a password. Its default value is PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256.
* `securityProvider`: Name of a Java Security Provider to be used for retrieving the configured secret key factory and the cipher. Its default value is null.

NOTE: Older Java versions may not support all the algorithms used as defaults. Please use the property values supported your Java version.


As a usage example, let's create a password file and generate the encrypted strings out of this file.

1 -  Create the password file: `echo '/Za-uG3dDfpd,5.-' > /opt/master-password`

2 -  Define the encrypted variables:

```
java -cp hazelcast-*.jar \
    -DpasswordFile=/opt/master-password \
    -DpasswordUserProperties=false \
    com.hazelcast.config.replacer.EncryptionReplacer \
    "aGroup"
$ENC{Gw45stIlan0=:531:yVN9/xQpJ/Ww3EYkAPvHdA==}

java -cp hazelcast-*.jar \
    -DpasswordFile=/opt/master-password \
    -DpasswordUserProperties=false \
    com.hazelcast.config.replacer.EncryptionReplacer \
    "aPasswordToEncrypt"
$ENC{wJxe1vfHTgg=:531:WkAEdSi//YWEbwvVNoU9mUyZ0DE49acJeaJmGalHHfA=}
```

3 - Configure the replacer and put the encrypted variables into the configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <config-replacers>
        <replacer class-name="com.hazelcast.config.replacer.EncryptionReplacer">
            <properties>
                <property name="passwordFile">/opt/master-password</property>
                <property name="passwordUserProperties">false</property>
            </properties>
        </replacer>
    </config-replacers>
    <group>
        <name>$ENC{Gw45stIlan0=:531:yVN9/xQpJ/Ww3EYkAPvHdA==}</name>
        <password>$ENC{wJxe1vfHTgg=:531:WkAEdSi/YWEbwvVNoU9mUyZ0DE49acJeaJmGalHHfA=}</password>
    </group>
</hazelcast>
----

4 - Check if the decryption works:

```
java -jar hazelcast-*.jar
Apr 06, 2018 10:15:43 AM com.hazelcast.config.XmlConfigLocator
INFO: Loading 'hazelcast.xml' from working directory.
Apr 06, 2018 10:15:44 AM com.hazelcast.instance.AddressPicker
INFO: [LOCAL] [aGroup] [3.10-SNAPSHOT] Prefer IPv4 stack is true.
```

As you can see in the logs, the correctly decrypted group name value ("aGroup") is used.

==== PropertyReplacer

The `PropertyReplacer` replaces variables by properties with the given name. Usually the system properties are used, e.g., `${user.name}`. There is no need to define it in the declarative configuration files.

Its full class name is `com.hazelcast.config.replacer.PropertyReplacer` and the replacer prefix is empty string ("").


==== Implementing Custom Replacers

You can also provide your own replacer implementations. All replacers have to implement the interface `com.hazelcast.config.replacer.spi.ConfigReplacer`. A simple snippet is shown below.

[source,java]
----
public interface ConfigReplacer {
    void init(Properties properties);
    String getPrefix();
    String getReplacement(String maskedValue);
}
----
