== Storage

This chapter describes Hazelcast's High-Density Memory Store and Hot Restart Persistence features along with their configurations and gives recommendations on the storage sizing.

=== High-Density Memory Store

[navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*

By default, data structures in Hazelcast store data on heap in serialized form for highest data compaction; yet, these data structures are still subject to Java Garbage Collection (GC). Modern hardware has much more available memory. If you want to make use of that hardware and scale up by specifying higher heap sizes, GC becomes an increasing problem: the application faces long GC pauses that make the application unresponsive. Also, you may get out of memory errors if you fill your whole heap. Garbage collection, which is the automatic process that manages the application's runtime memory, often forces you into configurations where multiple JVMs with small heaps (sizes of 2-4GB per member) run on a single physical hardware device to avoid garbage collection pauses. This results in oversized clusters to hold the data and leads to performance level requirements.

In [navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*, the High-Density Memory Store is Hazelcast's new enterprise in-memory storage solution. It solves garbage collection limitations so that applications can exploit hardware memory more efficiently without the need of oversized clusters. High-Density Memory Store is designed as a pluggable memory manager which enables multiple memory stores for different data structures. These memory stores are all accessible by a common access layer that scales up to terabytes of the main memory on a single JVM by minimizing the GC pressure. High-Density Memory Store enables predictable application scaling and boosts performance and latency while minimizing garbage collection pauses.

This foundation includes, but is not limited to, storing keys and values next to the heap in a native memory region.

High-Density Memory Store is currently provided for the following Hazelcast features and implementations:

* <<using-high-density-memory-store-with-map, Map>>
* <<icache-configuration, JCache Implementation>>

* https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-hibernate[Hibernate 2nd Level Caching]

==== Configuring High-Density Memory Store

To use the High-Density memory storage, the native memory usage must be enabled using the programmatic or declarative configuration.
Also, you can configure its size, memory allocator type, minimum block size, page size and metadata space percentage.

* **size:** Size of the total native memory to allocate in megabytes. Its default value is **512 MB**.
* **allocator type**: Type of the memory allocator. Available values are as follows:
** **STANDARD**: This option is used internally by Hazelcast's POOLED allocator type or for debugging/testing purposes.
*** With this option, the memory is allocated or deallocated using your operating system's default memory manager.
*** It uses GNU C Library's standard `malloc()` and `free()` methods which are subject to contention on multithreaded/multicore systems.
*** Memory operations may become slower when you perform a lot of small allocations and deallocations.
*** It may cause large memory fragmentations, unless you use a method in the background that emphasizes fragmentation avoidance, such as `jemalloc()`. Note that a large memory fragmentation can trigger the Linux Out of Memory Killer if there is no swap space enabled in your system. Even if the swap space is enabled, the killer can be again triggered if there is not enough swap space left.
*** If you still want to use the operating system's default memory management, you can set the allocator type to STANDARD in your native memory configuration.
** **POOLED**: This is the default option, Hazelcast's own pooling memory allocator.
*** With this option, memory blocks are managed using internal memory pools.
*** It allocates memory blocks, each of which has a 4MB page size by default, and splits them into chunks or merges them to create larger chunks when required. Sizing of these chunks follows the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation[buddy memory allocation] algorithm, i.e. power-of-two sizing.
*** It never frees memory blocks back to the operating system. It marks disposed memory blocks as available to be used later, meaning that these blocks are reusable.
*** Memory allocation and deallocation operations (except the ones requiring larger sizes than the page size) do not interact with the operating system mostly.
*** For memory allocation, it tries to find the requested memory size inside the internal memory pools. If it cannot be found, then it interacts with the operating system.
* **minimum block size:** Minimum size of the blocks in bytes to split and fragment a page block to assign to an allocation request. It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Its default value is **16 bytes**.
* **page size:** Size of the page in bytes to allocate memory as a block. It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Its default value is `1 << 22` = **4194304 Bytes**, about **4 MB**.
* **metadata space percentage:** Defines the percentage of the allocated native memory that is used for internal memory structures by the High-Density Memory for tracking the used and available memory blocks. It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Its default value is **12.5**. Please note that when the memory runs out, you will get a `NativeOutOfMemoryException`;  if your store has a big size of entries, you should consider increasing this percentage.

The following is the programmatic configuration example.

The following is the declarative configuration example.

<native-memory allocator-type="POOLED" enabled="true">
     <size unit="MEGABYTES" value="512"/>
     <min-block-size>16</min-block-size>
     <page-size>4194304</page-size>
     <metadata-space-percentage>12.5</metadata-space-percentage>
</native-memory>
----

NOTE: You can check whether there is enough free physical memory for the requested number of bytes using the system property `hazelcast.hidensity.check.freememory`. Please see the <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>> on how to use Hazelcast system properties.


=== Sizing Practices

Data in Hazelcast is both active data and backup data for high availability, so the total memory footprint is the size of active data plus the size of backup data. If you use a single backup, it means the total memory footprint is two times the active data (active data + backup data). If you use, for example, two backups, then the total memory footprint is three times the active data (active data + backup data + backup data).

If you use only heap memory, each Hazelcast member with a 4 GB heap should accommodate a maximum of 3.5 GB of total data (active and backup). If you use the High-Density Memory Store, up to 75% of the configured physical memory footprint may be used for active and backup data, with headroom of 25% for normal memory fragmentation. In both cases, however, you should also keep some memory headroom available to handle any member failure or explicit member shutdown. When a member leaves the cluster, the data previously owned by the newly offline member will be distributed among the remaining members. For this reason, we recommend that you plan to use only 60% of available memory, with 40% headroom to handle member failure or shutdown.

=== Hot Restart Persistence

[navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*

This chapter explains the Hazelcast's Hot Restart Persistence feature, introduced with Hazelcast 3.6. Hot Restart Persistence provides fast cluster restarts by storing the states of the cluster members on the disk. This feature is currently provided for the Hazelcast map data structure and the Hazelcast JCache implementation.

==== Hot Restart Persistence Overview

Hot Restart Persistence enables you to get your cluster up and running swiftly after a cluster restart. A restart can be caused by a planned shutdown (including rolling upgrades) or a sudden cluster-wide crash, e.g., power outage. For Hot Restart Persistence, required states for Hazelcast clusters and members are introduced. Please refer to the <<managing-cluster-and-member-states, Managing Cluster and Member States section>> for information on the cluster and member states. The purpose of the Hot Restart Persistence is to provide a maintenance window for member operations and restart the cluster in a fast way. It is not meant to recover the catastrophic shutdown of one member.

==== Hot Restart Types

The Hot Restart feature is supported for the following restart types:

* **Restart after a planned shutdown**:
** The cluster is shut down completely and restarted with the exact same previous setup and data.
+
You can shut down the cluster completely using the method `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown()` or you can manually change the cluster state to `PASSIVE` and then shut down each member one by one. When you send the command to shut the cluster down, i.e. `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown()`, the members that are not in the `PASSIVE` state temporarily change their states to `PASSIVE`. Then, each member shuts itself down by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`.
+
Difference between explicitly changing state to `PASSIVE` before shutdown and shutting down cluster directly via `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown()` is, on latter case when cluster is restarted, cluster state will be in the latest state before shutdown. That means if cluster is `ACTIVE` before shutdown, cluster state will automatically become `ACTIVE` after restart is completed.
+
** Rolling restart: The cluster is restarted intentionally member by member. For example, this could be done to install an operating system patch or new hardware.
+
To be able to shut down the cluster member by member as part of a planned restart, each member in the cluster should be in the `FROZEN` or `PASSIVE` state. After the cluster state is changed to `FROZEN` or `PASSIVE`, you can manually shut down each member by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`. When that member is restarted, it will rejoin the running cluster. After all members are restarted, the cluster state can be changed back to `ACTIVE`.
* **Restart after a cluster crash**: The cluster is restarted after all its members crashed at the same time due to a power outage, networking interruptions, etc.

==== Restart Process

During the restart process, each member waits to load data until all the members in the partition table are started. During this process, no operations are allowed. Once all cluster members are started, Hazelcast changes the cluster state to `PASSIVE` and starts to load data. When all data is loaded, Hazelcast changes the cluster state to its previous known state before shutdown and starts to accept the operations which are allowed by the restored cluster state.

If a member fails to either start, join the cluster in time (within the timeout), or load its data, then that member will be terminated immediately. After the problems causing the failure are fixed, that member can be restarted. If the cluster start cannot be completed in time, then all members will fail to start. Please refer to the <<configuring-hot-restart, Configuring Hot Restart section>> for defining timeouts.

In the case of a restart after a cluster crash, the Hot Restart feature realizes that it was not a clean shutdown and Hazelcast tries to restart the cluster with the last saved data following the process explained above. In some cases, specifically when the cluster crashes while it has an ongoing partition migration process, currently it is not possible to restore the last saved state.

===== Restart of a Member in Running Cluster

Assume the following:

- You have a cluster consisting of members A, B and C with Hot Restart enabled, which is initially stable.
- Member B is killed.
- Member B restarts.

Since only a single member has failed, the cluster performed the standard High Availability routine by recovering member B's data from backups and redistributing the data among the remaining members (the members A and B in this case). Member B's persisted Hot Restart data is completely irrelevant.

Furthermore, when a member starts with existing Hot Restart data, it expects to find itself within a cluster that has been shut down as a whole and is now restarting as a whole. Since the reality is that the cluster has been running all along, member B's persisted cluster state does not match the actual state. Therefore, member B aborts initialization and shuts down.

As another scenario, assume the following:

- You have a cluster consisting of members A, B and C with Hot Restart enabled, which is initially stable.
- Member B is killed.
- Member B's Hot Restart <<configuring-hot-restart, base directory (`base-dir`)>> must be deleted.
- Member B restarts.

Now member B joins the cluster as a fresh, empty member. The cluster will assign some partitions to it, unrelated to the partitions it owned before going down.

==== Force Start

A member can crash permanently and then be unable to recover from the failure. In that case, restart process cannot be completed since some of the members do not start or fail to load their own data. In that case, you can force the cluster to clean its persisted data and make a fresh start. This process is called **force start**.

Assume the following which is a valid scenario to use force start:

- You have a cluster consisting of members A and B which is initially stable.
- Cluster transitions into `FROZEN` or `PASSIVE` state.
- Cluster gracefully shuts down.
- Member A restarts, but member B does not.
- Member A uses its Hot Restart data to initiate the Hot Restart procedure.
- Since it knows the cluster originally contained member B as well, it waits for it to join.
- This never happens.
- Now you have the choice to Force Start the cluster without member B.
- Cluster discards all Hot Restart data and starts empty.

You can trigger the force start process using the Management Center, REST API and cluster management scripts.

Please note that force start is a destructive process, which results in deletion of persisted Hot Restart data.

Please refer to the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#hot-restart[Hot Restart functionality] of the Management Center section to learn how you can perform a force start using the Management Center.

==== Partial Start

When one or more members fail to start or have incorrect Hot Restart data (stale or corrupted data) or fail to load their Hot Restart data, cluster will become incomplete and restart mechanism cannot proceed. One solution is to use <<force-start, Force Start>> and make a fresh start with existing members. Another solution is to do a partial start.

Partial start means that the cluster will start with an incomplete member set. Data belonging to those missing members will be assumed lost and Hazelcast will try to recover missing data using the restored backups. For example, if you have minimum two backups configured for all maps and caches, then a partial start up to two missing members will be safe against data loss. If there are more than two missing members or there are maps/caches with less than two backups, then data loss is expected.

Partial start is controlled by `cluster-data-recovery-policy` configuration parameter and is not allowed by default. To enable partial start, one of the configuration values `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_RECENT` or `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_COMPLETE` should be set. Please see <<configuring-hot-restart, Configuring Hot Restart section>> for details.

When partial start is enabled, Hazelcast can perform a partial start automatically or manually, in case of some members are unable to restart successfully. Partial start proceeds automatically when some members fail to start and join to the cluster in `validation-timeout-seconds`. After the `validation-timeout-seconds` duration is passed, Hot Restart chooses to perform partial start with the members present in the cluster. Moreover, partial start can be requested manually using the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#hot-restart[Management Center], <<using-rest-api-for-cluster-management, REST API>> and <<example-usages-for-cluster-sh, cluster management scripts>> before the `validation-timeout-seconds` duration passes.

The other situation to decide to perform a partial start is failures during the data load phase. When Hazelcast learns data load result of all members which have passed the validation step, it automatically performs a partial start with the ones which have successfully restored their Hot Restart data. Please note that partial start does not expect every member to succeed in the data load step. It completes the process when it learns data load result for every member and there is at least one member which has successfully restored its Hot Restart data. Relatedly, if it cannot learn data load result of all members before `data-load-timeout-seconds` duration, it proceeds with the ones which have already completed the data load process.

Selection of members to perform partial start among live members is done according to the `cluster-data-recovery-policy` configuration. Set of members which are not selected by the `cluster-data-recovery-policy` are called `Excluded members` and they are instructed to perform <<force-start, force start>>. Excluded members are allowed to join cluster only when they clean their Hot Restart data and make a fresh-new start. This is a completely automatic process. For instance, if you start the missing members after partial start is completed, they clean their Hot Restart data and join to the cluster.

Please note that partial start is a destructive process. Once it is completed, it cannot be repeated with a new configuration. For this reason, one may need to perform the partial start process manually. Automatic behavior of partial start relies on `validation-timeout-seconds` and `data-load-timeout-seconds` configuration values. If you need to control the process manually, `validation-timeout-seconds` and `data-load-timeout-seconds` properties can be set to very big values so that Hazelcast cannot make progress on timeouts automatically. Then, the overall process can be managed manually via aforementioned methods, i.e. Management Center, REST API and cluster management scripts.

==== Configuring Hot Restart

You can configure Hot Restart feature programmatically or declaratively. There are two steps of configuration:

1. Enabling and configuring the Hot Restart feature globally in your Hazelcast configuration: This is done using the configuration element `hot-restart-persistence`. Please see the <<global-hot-restart-configuration, Global Hot Restart Configuration section>> below.
2. Enabling and configuring the Hazelcast data structures to use the Hot Restart feature: This is done using the configuration element `hot-restart`. Please see the <<per-data-structure-hot-restart-configuration, Per Data Structure Hot Restart Configuration section>> below.

===== Global Hot Restart Configuration

This is where you configure the Hot Restart feature itself using the `hot-restart-persistence` element. The following are the descriptions of its attribute and sub-elements:

* `enabled`: Attribute of the `hot-restart-persistence` element which specifies whether the feature is globally enabled in your Hazelcast configuration. Set this attribute to `true` if you want any of your data structures to use the Hot Restart feature.
* `base-dir`: Specifies the directory where the Hot Restart data will be stored. The default value for `base-dir` is `hot-restart`. You can use the default value, or you can specify the value of another folder containing the Hot Restart configuration, but it is mandatory that `base-dir` element has a value. This directory will be created automatically if it does not exist.
A single `base-dir` can be used only and only by a single Hazelcast member, it cannot be shared by multiple members. An attempt to use the same `base-dir` by multiple members will make these members abort the startup process except one which wins the ownership of the directory.
* `backup-dir`: Specifies the directory under which Hot Restart snapshots (Hot Backups) will be stored. Please see the <<hot-backup, Hot Backup section>> for more information.
* `parallelism`: Level of parallelism in Hot Restart Persistence. There will be this many IO threads, each writing in parallel to its own files. During the Hot Restart procedure, this many IO threads will be reading the files and this many rebuilder threads will be rebuilding the Hot Restart metadata. The default value for this property is 1. This is a good default in most but not all cases. You should measure the raw IO throughput of your infrastructure and test with different values of parallelism. In some cases such as dedicated hardware higher parallelism can yield more throughput of Hot Restart. In other cases such as running on EC2, it can yield diminishing returns - more thread scheduling, more contention on IO and less efficient garbage collection.
* `validation-timeout-seconds`: Validation timeout for the Hot Restart process when validating the cluster members expected to join and the partition table on the whole cluster.
* `data-load-timeout-seconds`: Data load timeout for the Hot Restart process. All members in the cluster should finish restoring their local data before this timeout.
* `cluster-data-recovery-policy`: Specifies the data recovery policy that will be respected during Hot Restart cluster start. Valid values are;
** `FULL_RECOVERY_ONLY`: Starts the cluster only when all expected members are present and correct. Otherwise, it fails. This is the default value.
** `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_RECENT`: Starts the cluster with the members which have most up-to-date partition table and successfully restored their data. All other members will leave the cluster and force start themselves. If no member restores its data successfully, cluster start fails.
** `PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_COMPLETE`: Starts the cluster with the largest group of members which have the same partition table version and successfully restored their data. All other members will leave the cluster and force start themselves. If no member restores its data successfully, cluster start fails.

===== Per Data Structure Hot Restart Configuration

This is where you configure the data structures of your choice, so that they can have the Hot Restart feature. This is done using the `hot-restart` configuration element. As it is explained in the <<hot-restart-persistence, introduction>> paragraph, Hot Restart feature is currently supported by Hazelcast map data structure and JCache implementation (`map` and `cache`), each of which has the `hot-restart` configuration element. The following are the descriptions of this element's attribute and sub-element:

* `enabled`: Attribute of the `hot-restart` element which specifies whether the Hot Restart feature is enabled for the related data structure. Its default value is `false`.
* `fsync`: Turning on `fsync` guarantees that data is persisted to the disk device when a write operation returns successful response to the caller. By default, `fsync` is turned off (`false`). That means data will be persisted to the disk device eventually, instead of on every disk write. This generally provides a better performance.

===== Hot Restart Configuration Examples

The following are example configurations for a Hazelcast map and JCache implementation.

**Declarative Configuration**:

An example configuration is shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
   ...
   <hot-restart-persistence enabled="true">
	   <base-dir>/mnt/hot-restart</base-dir>
	   <parallelism>1</parallelism>
	   <validation-timeout-seconds>120</validation-timeout-seconds>
	   <data-load-timeout-seconds>900</data-load-timeout-seconds>

==== Moving/Copying Hot Restart Data

After Hazelcast member owning the Hot Restart data is shutdown, Hot Restart `base-dir` can be copied/moved to a different server (which may have different IP address and/or different number of CPU cores) and Hazelcast member can be restarted using the existing Hot Restart data on that new server. Having a new IP address does not affect Hot Restart, since it does not rely on the IP address of the server but instead uses `Member` UUID as a unique identifier.

This flexibility provides;
- ability to replace one or more faulty servers with new ones easily without touching remaining cluster
- ability to use Hot Restart on cloud environments easily. Sometimes cloud providers do not preserve IP addresses on restart or after shutdown. Also it is possible to startup whole cluster on a different set of machines.
- ability to copy production data to test environment, so that a more functional test cluster can bet setup

Unfortunately having different number of CPU cores is not that straightforward. Hazelcast partition threads, by default, will use a heuristic from the number of cores, e.g., `# of partition threads = # of CPU cores`. When Hazelcast member is started on a server with a different CPU core count, number of Hazelcast partition threads will change and that will make Hot Restart fail during startup. Solution is to explicitly set number of Hazelcast partition threads (`hazelcast.operation.thread.count` system property) and Hot Restart `parallelism` configuration and use the same parameters on the new server. For setting system properties see <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>>.

==== Hot Restart Persistence Design Details

Hazelcast's Hot Restart Persistence uses the log-structured storage approach. The following is a top-level design description:

- The only kind of update operation on persistent data is _appending_.
- What is appended are facts about events that happened to the data model represented by the store; either a new value was assigned to a key or a key was removed.
- Each record associated with a key makes stale the previous record that was associated with that key.
- Stale records contribute to the amount of _garbage_ present in the persistent storage.
- Measures are taken to remove garbage from the storage.

This kind of design focuses almost all of the system's complexity into the garbage collection (GC) process, stripping down the client's operation to the bare necessity of guaranteeing persistent behavior: a simple file append operation. Consequently, the latency of operations is close to the theoretical minimum in almost all cases. Complications arise only during prolonged periods of maximum load; this is where the details of the GC process begin to matter.

==== Concurrent, Incremental, Generational GC

In order to maintain the lowest possible footprint in the update operation latency, the following properties are built into the garbage collection process:

* A dedicated thread performs the GC. In Hazelcast terms, this thread is called the Collector and the application thread is called the Mutator.
* On each update there is metadata to be maintained; this is done asynchronously by the Collector thread. The Mutator enqueues update events to the Collector's work queue.
* The Collector keeps draining its work queue at all times, including the time it goes through the GC cycle. Updates are taken into account at each stage in the GC cycle, preventing the copying of already dead records into compacted files.
* All GC-induced I/O competes for the same resources as the Mutator's update operations. Therefore, measures are taken to minimize the impact of I/O done during GC:
** data is never read from files, but from RAM;
** a heuristic scheme is employed which minimizes the number of bytes written to disk for each kilobyte of reclaimed garbage;
** measures are also taken to achieve a good interleaving of Collector and Mutator operations, minimizing latency outliers perceived by the Mutator.

===== I/O Minimization Scheme

The success of this scheme is subject to a bet on the Weak Generational Garbage Hypothesis, which states that a new record entering the system is likely to become garbage soon. In other words, a key updated now is more likely than average to be updated again soon.

The scheme was taken from the seminal Sprite LFS paper, http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/LFS.pdf[Rosenblum, Ousterhout, _The Design and Implementation of a Log-Structured File System_]. The following is an outline of the paper:

* Data is not written to one huge file, but to many files of moderate size (8 MB) called "chunks".
* Garbage is collected incrementally, i.e. by choosing several chunks, then copying all their live data to new chunks, then deleting the old ones.
* I/O is minimized using a collection technique which results in a bimodal distribution of chunks with respect to their garbage content: most files are either almost all live data or they are all garbage.
* The technique consists of two main principles:
** Chunks are selected based on their _Cost-Benefit factor_ (see below).
** Records are sorted by age before copying to new chunks.

===== Cost-Benefit Factor

The Cost-Benefit factor of a chunk consists of two components multiplied together:

. The ratio of benefit (amount of garbage that can be collected) to I/O cost (amount of live data to be written).
. The age of the data in the chunk, measured as the age of the youngest record it contains.

The essence is in the second component: given equal amount of garbage in all chunks, it will make the young ones less attractive to the Collector. Assuming the generational garbage hypothesis, this will allow the young chunks to quickly accumulate more garbage. On the flip side, it will also ensure that even files with little garbage are eventually garbage collected. This removes garbage which would otherwise linger on, thinly spread across many chunk files.

Sorting records by age will group young records together in a single chunk and will do the same for older records. Therefore the chunks will either tend to keep their data live for a longer time, or quickly become full of garbage.

==== Hot Restart Performance Considerations

In this section you can find performance test summaries which are results of benchmark tests performed with a single Hazelcast member running on a physical server and on AWS R3.

===== Performance on a Physical Server

The member has the following:

- An IMap data structure with High-Density Memory Store.
- Its data size is changed for each test, started from 10 GB to 500 GB (each map entry has a value of 1 KB).

The tests investigate the write and read performance of Hot Restart Persistence and are performed on HP ProLiant servers with RHEL 7 operating system using Hazelcast Simulator.

The following are the specifications of the server hardware used for the test:

* CPU: 2x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2687W v3 @ 3.10GHz – with 10 cores per processor. Total 20 cores, 40 with hyper threading enabled.
* Memory: 768GB 2133 MHz memory 24x HP 32GB 4Rx4 PC4-2133P-L Kit

The following are the storage media used for the test:

* A hot-pluggable 2.5 inch HDD with 1 TB capacity and 10K RPM.
* An SSD, Light Endurance PCle Workload Accelerator.

The below table shows the test results.

image::HotRestartPerf.png[Hot Restart Perf]


===== Performance on AWS R3

The member has the following:

- An IMap data structure with High-Density Memory Store.
- IMap has 40 million distinct keys, each map entry is 1 KB.
- High-Density Memory Store is 59 GiB whose 19% is metadata.
- Hot Restart is configured with `fsync` turned off.
- Data size reloaded on restart is 38 GB.

The tests investigate the write and read performance of Hot Restart Persistence and are performed on R3.2xlarge and R3.4xlarge EC2 instances using Hazelcast Simulator.

The following are the AWS storage types used for the test:

- Elastic Block Storage (EBS) General Purpose SSD (GP2).
- Elastic Block Storage with Provisioned IOPS (IO1). Provisioned 10,000 IOPS on a 340 GiB volume, enabled EBS-optimized on instance.
- SSD-backed instance store.

The below table shows the test results.

==== Hot Backup

During Hot Restart operations you can take a snapshot of the Hot Restart Store at a certain point in time. This is useful when you wish to bring up a new cluster with the same data or parts of the data. The new cluster can then be used to share load with the original cluster, to perform testing, QA or reproduce an issue on production data.

Simple file copying of a currently running cluster does not suffice and can produce inconsistent snapshots with problems such as resurrection of deleted values or missing values.

===== Configuring Hot Backup

To create snapshots you must first configure the Hot Restart backup directory. You can configure the directory programmatically or declaratively using the following configuration element:

- `backup-dir`: This element is included in the `hot-restart-persistence` and denotes the destination under which backups will be stored. If this element is not defined, hot backup will be disabled. If a directory is defined which does not exist, it will be created on the first backup. To avoid clashing data on multiple backups, each backup has a unique sequence ID which determines the name of the directory which will contain all Hot Restart data. This unique directory is created as a subdirectory of the configured `backup-dir`.

The following are examples configurations for Hot backup.

**Declarative Configuration**:

An example configuration is shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
   ...
   <hot-restart-persistence enabled="true">
	   ...
	   <backup-dir>/mnt/hot-backup</backup-dir>
	   ...
   </hot-restart-persistence>
   ...
</hazelcast>
----


**Programmatic Configuration**:

The programmatic equivalent of the above declarative configuration is shown below.

[source,java]
----
HotRestartPersistenceConfig hotRestartPersistenceConfig = new HotRestartPersistenceConfig();
hotRestartPersistenceConfig.setBackupDir(new File("/mnt/hot-backup"));
...
config.setHotRestartPersistenceConfig(hotRestartPersistenceConfig);
----

===== Using Hot Backup

Once configured, you can initiate a new backup via API or from the Management Center. The backup is started transactionally and cluster-wide. This means that either all or none of the members will start the same backup. The member which receives the backup request will determine a new backup sequence ID and send that information to all members. If all members respond that no other backup is currently in progress and that no other backup request has already been made, then the coordinating member will command the other members to start the actual backup process. This will create a directory under the configured `backup-dir` with the name `backup-<backupSeq>` and start copying the data from the original store.

The backup process is initiated nearly instantaneously on all members. Note that since there is no limitation as to when the backup process is initiated, it may be initiated during membership changes, partition table changes or during normal data update. Some of these operations may not be completed fully yet, which means that some members will backup some data while some members will backup a previous version of the same data. This will usually be solved by the anti-entropy mechanism on the new cluster which will reconcile different versions of the same data. Please check the <<achieving-high-consistency-of-backup-data, Achieving High Consistency of Backup Data section>> for more information.

The duration of the backup process and the disk data usage drastically depends on what is supported by the system and the configuration. Please check the <<achieving-high-performance-of-backup-process, Achieving high performance of backup process section>> for more information on achieving better resource usage of the backup process.

Following is an example of how to trigger the Hot Backup via API:

[source,java]
----
HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService();
service.backup();
----

The `backupSeq` is generated by the hot backup process, but you can define your own backup sequences as shown below:

[source,java]
----
HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService();
long backupSeq = ...
service.backup(backupSeq);
----

Keep in mind that the backup will fail if any member contains a backup directory with the name `backup-<backupSeq>`, where `backupSeq` is the given sequence.

===== Starting the Cluster From a Hot Backup

As mentioned in the previous section, hot backup process creates subdirectories named `backup-<backupSeq>` under the configured <<configuring-hot-backup, hot backup directory>> (i.e., `backup-dir`). When starting your cluster with data from a hot backup, you need to set the <<global-hot-restart-configuration, base directory>> (i.e., `base-dir`) to the desired backup subdirectory.

Let's say you have configured your hot backup directory as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
   ...
   <hot-restart-persistence enabled="true">
	   ...
	   <backup-dir>/mnt/hot-backup</backup-dir>
	   ...
   </hot-restart-persistence>
   ...
</hazelcast>
----

And let's say you have a subdirectory named `backup-2018Oct24` under the backup directory `/mnt/hot-backup`. When you want to start your cluster with data from this backup (`backup-2018Oct24`), here is the configuration you should have for the `base-dir` while starting the cluster:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
   ...
   <hot-restart-persistence enabled="true">
	   ...
	   <base-dir>backup-2018Oct24</base-dir>
	   <parallelism>1</parallelism>
	   ...
	   ...
   </hot-restart-persistence>
   ...
   <map name="test-map">
	   <hot-restart enabled="true">
		   <fsync>false</fsync>
	   </hot-restart>
   </map>
   ...
</hazelcast>
----


===== Achieving High Consistency of Backup Data

The backup is initiated nearly simultaneously on all members but you can encounter some inconsistencies in the data. This is because some members might have and some might not have received updated values yet from executed operations, because the system could be undergoing partition and membership changes or because there are some transactions which have not yet been committed.

To achieve a high consistency of data on all members, the cluster should be put to `PASSIVE` state for the duration of the call to the backup method. See the <<cluster-member-states, Cluster Member States section>> on information on how to do this. The cluster does not need to be in `PASSIVE` state for the entire duration of the backup process, though. Because of the design, only partition metadata is copied synchronously during the invocation of the backup method. Once the backup method has returned all cluster metadata has been copied and the exact partition data which needs to be copied will have been marked. After that, the backup process continues asynchronously and you can return the cluster to the `ACTIVE` state and resume operations.

===== Achieving High Performance of Backup Process

Because of the design of Hot Restart Store, we can use hard links to achieve backups/snapshots of the store. The hot backup process will use hard links whenever possible because they provide big performance benefits and because the backups share disk usage.

The performance benefit comes from the fact that Hot Restart file contents are not being duplicated (thus using disk and IO resources) but rather a new file name is created for the same contents on disk (another pointer to the same inode). Since all backups and stores share the same inode, disk usage drops.

The bigger the percentage of stable data in the Hot Restart Store (data not undergoing changes), the more files will each backup share with the operational Hot Restart Store and the less disk space it will be using. For the hot backup to use hard links, you must be running Hazelcast members on JDK 7 or higher and must satisfy all requirements for the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#createLink(java.nio.file.Path,%20java.nio.file.Path)[`Files.createLink()` method] to be supported.

The backup process will initially attempt to create a new hard link and if that fails for any reason it will continue by copying the data. Subsequent backups will also attempt to use hard links.

===== Backup Process Progress and Completion

Only cluster and distributed object metadata is copied synchronously during the invocation of the backup method. The rest of the Hot Restart Store containing partition data will be copied asynchronously after the method call has ended. You can track the progress by API or view it from the Management Center.

An example of how to track the progress via API is shown below:

[source,java]
----
HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService();
BackupTaskStatus status = service.getBackupTaskStatus();
...
----

The returned object contains local member backup status:

- the backup state (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, FAILURE, SUCCESS)
- the completed count
- the total count


The completed and total count can provide you a way to track the percentage of the copied data. Currently the count defines the number of copied and total local member Hot Restart Stores (defined by `HotRestartPersistenceConfig.setParallelism()`) but this can change at a later point to provide greater resolution.

Besides tracking the Hot Restart status by API, you can view the status in the Management Center and you can inspect the on-disk files for each member. Each member creates an `inprogress` file which is created in each of the copied Hot Restart Stores. This means that the backup is currently in progress. As the backup task completes the backup operation, the file will be removed. If an error occurs during the backup task, the `inprogress` file will be renamed to `failure` and it will contain a stack trace of the exception.

===== Backup Task Interruption and Cancellation

Once the backup method call has returned and asynchronous copying of the partition data has started, the backup task can be interrupted. This is helpful in situations where the backup task has started at an inconvenient time. For instance, the backup task could be automatized and it could be accidentally triggered during high load on the Hazelcast instances, causing the performance of the Hazelcast instances to drop.

The backup task mainly uses disk IO, consumes little CPU and it generally does not last for a long time (although you should test it with your environment to determine the exact impact). Nevertheless, you can abort the backup tasks on all members via a cluster-wide interrupt operation. This operation can be triggered programmatically or from the Management Center.

An example of programmatic interruption is shown below:

[source,java]
----
HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService();
service.interruptBackupTask();
...
----

This method will send an interrupt to all members. The interrupt is ignored if the backup task is currently not in progress so you can safely call this method even though it has previously been called or when some members have already completed their local backup tasks.

You can also interrupt the local member backup task as shown below:

[source,java]
----
HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService();
service.interruptLocalBackupTask();
...
----

The backup task will stop as soon as possible and it will not remove the disk contents of the backup directory meaning that you must remove it manually.


=== Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache

[blue]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise*

With Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache, you can reduce the latency of propagation of data from your backend database into your Hazelcast cache to milliseconds. You have the flexibility to run multiple applications off a single database, keeping Hazelcast cache refreshes current while adhering to low latency SLAs.

This joint solution with Hazelcast's in-memory data grid uses Striim's Change Data Capture (CDC) to solve the cache consistency problems.

When you have an application that needs to retrieve and store information in a database, you can use a Hazelcast in-memory cache for rapid access to data. There may be some other applications that make database updates; in this case, your application may show out-of-date or invalid information.

Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache solves this by using streaming CDC to synchronize the cache with the database in real time. This ensures that both the cache and your application always have the most current data.

Through CDC, Striim is able to recognize which tables and key values have changed. It immediately captures these changes with their table and key, and pushes the changes into the cache using the Hazelcast Striim writer.
