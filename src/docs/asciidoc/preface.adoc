== Preface

Welcome to the Hazelcast IMDG (In-Memory Data Grid) Reference Manual. This manual includes concepts, instructions and samples to guide you on how to use Hazelcast and build Hazelcast IMDG applications.

As the reader of this manual, you must be familiar with the Java programming language and you should have installed your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

[[hazelcast-imdg-editions]]

[[hazelcast-imdg-architecture]]
=== Hazelcast IMDG Architecture

You can see the features for all Hazelcast IMDG editions in the following architecture diagram.

NOTE: You can see small "HD" boxes for some features in the above diagram. Those features can use High-Density (HD) Memory Store when it is available. It means if you have Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD, you can use those features with HD Memory Store.

For more information on Hazelcast IMDG's Architecture, please see the white paper https://hazelcast.com/resources/architects-view-hazelcast/[An Architect's View of Hazelcast].

[[phone-home]]
=== Phone Home

Hazelcast uses phone home data to learn about usage of Hazelcast IMDG.

Hazelcast IMDG member instances call our phone home server initially when they are started and then every 24 hours. This applies to all the instances joined to the cluster.

**What is sent in?**

The following information is sent in a phone home:

* Hazelcast IMDG version
* Local Hazelcast IMDG member UUID
* Download ID 
* A hash value of the cluster ID
* Cluster size bands for 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, 150, 300, 600 and > 600
* Number of connected clients bands of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, 150, 300, 600 and > 600
* Cluster uptime
* Member uptime
* Environment Information:
** Name of operating system
** Kernel architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
** Version of operating system
** Version of installed Java
** Name of Java Virtual Machine
* Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise specific: 
** Number of clients by language (Java, C++, C#)
** Flag for Hazelcast Enterprise 
** Hash value of license key
** Native memory usage
* Hazelcast Management Center specific: 
** Hazelcast Management Center version
** Hash value of Hazelcast Management Center license key

**Phone Home Code**

The phone home code itself is open source. Please see http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/util/PhoneHome.html[here].

**Disabling Phone Homes**

Set the `hazelcast.phone.home.enabled` system property to false either in the config or on the Java command line. Please see the <<system-properties, System Properties section>> for information on how to set a property. 

You can also disable the phone home using the environment variable `HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED`. Simply add the following line to your `.bash_profile`:

```
export HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED=false
```
