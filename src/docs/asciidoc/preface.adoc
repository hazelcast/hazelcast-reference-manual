== Preface

Welcome to the Hazelcast IMDG (In-Memory Data Grid) Reference Manual.
This manual includes concepts, instructions and examples to guide you on
how to use Hazelcast and build Hazelcast IMDG applications.

This reference manual mostly talks about the Hazelcast member and clients

programming language, it has the following clients and programming language APIs.

* Node.js
* Python
* Go
* Scala

We recommend you to learn the basics of Hazelcast IMDG using this manual first. Then,
you can always get the client related resources/links in the <<hazelcast-clients, Clients chapter>>.
