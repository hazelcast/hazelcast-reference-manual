Then, these member list versions are used to identify the joined members with unique integers. For this algorithm to work under network partitioning scenarios, without generating duplicate member list join versions for different members, a mastership-claiming member increments the member list version as specified by this parameter, multiplied by its position in the member list. The value of the parameter must be bigger than the cluster size.

|`hazelcast.mastership.claim.timeout.seconds`

|`hazelcast.max.no.master.confirmation.seconds`
| 150
| int
| Max timeout of master confirmation from other members. This property is deprecated as of this (3.10) release.

|`hazelcast.max.wait.seconds.before.join`

|`hazelcast.nio.tcp.spoofing.checks`
| false
| bool
| Controls whether more strict checks upon BIND requests towards a cluster member are applied. The checks mainly validate the remote BIND request against the remote address as found in the socket. By default they are disabled, to avoid connectivity issues when deployed under NAT'ed infrastructure.

|`hazelcast.operation.backup.timeout.millis`
|5000
|int
|Maximum time a caller to wait for backup responses of an operation. After this timeout, operation response will be returned to the caller even no backup response is received.

|`hazelcast.operation.fail.on.indeterminate.state`

|Specifies whether the response thread for internal operations at the member side will be blocked or not. If you use `block` (the default value) the thread will be blocked and need to be notified which can cause a reduction in the performance. If you use `backoff` there will be no blocking. By enabling the backoff mode and depending on your use case, you can get a 5-10% performance improvement. However, keep in mind that this will increase CPU utilization. We recommend you to use backoff with care and if you have a tool for measuring your cluster's performance.

|`hazelcast.partition.migration.fragments.enabled`
| true
| bool
| When enabled, which is the default behavior, partitions are migrated/replicated in small fragments instead of one big chunk. Migrating partitions in fragments reduces pressure on the memory and network, since smaller packets are created in the memory and sent through the network. Note that it can increase the migration time to complete.

|`hazelcast.partition.migration.interval`
| 0
| int
| Interval to run partition migration tasks in seconds.

|`hazelcast.partition.migration.stale.read.disabled`

|`hazelcast.query.predicate.parallel.evaluation`
|false
|bool
|Each Hazelcast member evaluates query predicates using a single thread by default. In most cases, the overhead of inter-thread communications overweight can benefit from parallel execution.

|`hazelcast.query.result.size.limit`
|-1
|int
|Result size limit for query operations on maps. This value defines the maximum number of returned elements for a single query result. If a query exceeds this number of elements, a QueryResultSizeExceededException is thrown. Its default value is -1, meaning it is disabled.

|`hazelcast.rest.enabled`
| false
| bool
| Enable <<rest-client, REST>> client request listener service.

| bool
| Enable Hazelcast shutdownhook thread. When this is enabled, this thread terminates the Hazelcast instance without waiting to shutdown gracefully.

|`hazelcast.shutdownhook.policy`
|TERMINATE
|string
| Specifies the behavior when JVM is exiting while the Hazelcast instance is still running. It has two values: TERMINATE and GRACEFUL. The former one terminates the Hazelcast instance immediately. The latter, GRACEFUL, initiates the graceful shutdown which can significantly slow down the JVM exit process, but it tries to retain data safety. Note that you should always shutdown Hazelcast explicitly via using the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`. It's not recommended to rely on the shutdown hook, this is a last-effort measure.

|`hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.enabled`
|true
|bool
|Enables/disables the <<slowoperationdetector, SlowOperationDetector>>.

|10000
|int
|Defines a threshold above which a running operation in `OperationService` is considered to be slow. These operations log a warning and are shown in the Management Center with detailed information, e.g., stacktrace.

|`hazelcast.socket.bind.any`

| Bind both server-socket and client-sockets to any local interface.

|`hazelcast.socket.buffer.direct`
| false
| bool
| Specifies whether the byte buffers used in the socket should be a direct byte buffer (`true`) or a regular one (`false`). When it is set to `true`, Hazelcast internally uses the method `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect` (instead of `ByteBuffer.allocate`) which makes use of the off-heap and may skip the memory copying when performing socket I/O operations. See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html[here] for more information.

|`hazelcast.socket.client.bind`
|true
|bool

|`hazelcast.socket.client.receive.buffer.size`
|-1
|int
|Hazelcast creates all connections with receive buffer size set according to the `hazelcast.socket.receive.buffer.size`. When it detects a connection opened by a client, then it adjusts the receive buffer size according to this property. It is in kilobytes and its default value is -1.

|`hazelcast.socket.client.send.buffer.size`
|-1
|int
|Hazelcast creates all connections with send buffer size set according to the `hazelcast.socket.send.buffer.size`. When it detects a connection opened by a client, then it adjusts the send buffer size according to this property. It is in kilobytes and its  default value is -1.

|`hazelcast.socket.connect.timeout.seconds`
|0
|int
|Socket connection timeout in seconds. `Socket.connect()` will be blocked until either connection is established or connection is refused or this timeout passes. Default is 0, means infinite.

|`hazelcast.socket.keep.alive`
| true
| bool
| Socket set keep alive (`SO_KEEPALIVE`).

|`hazelcast.socket.linger.seconds`
|0
|int
|Set socket `SO_LINGER` option.

| true
| bool
| Socket set TCP no delay.

|`hazelcast.socket.receive.buffer.size`
| 128
| int
| Socket receive buffer (`SO_RCVBUF`) size in KB. If you have a very fast network, e.g., 10gbit) and/or you have large entries, then you may benefit from increasing sender/receiver buffer sizes. Use this property and the next one below tune the size.

|`hazelcast.socket.send.buffer.size`
| 128
| int
| Socket send buffer (`SO_SNDBUF`) size in KB.

|`hazelcast.socket.server.bind.any`
| true
| bool
| Bind server-socket to any local interface. If not set, `hazelcast.socket.bind.any` will be used as default.

|`hazelcast.tcp.join.port.try.count`
|3
|int
|The number of incremental ports, starting with the port number defined in the network configuration, that will be used to connect to a host (which is defined without a port in TCP/IP member list while a member is searching for a cluster).

|`hazelcast.unsafe.mode`
| auto
| string
| "auto" (the default value) automatically detects whether the usage of `Unsafe` is suitable for a given platform. "disabled" explicitly disables the `Unsafe` usage in your platform. "enforced" enforces the usage of `Unsafe` even if your platform does not support it. This property can only be set by passing a JVM-wide system property.

|`hazelcast.phone.home.enabled`
| true
| bool
| Enable or disable the sending of phone home data to Hazelcast's phone home server.

|`hazelcast.wait.seconds.before.join`
| 5
| int
| Wait time before join operation.

|`hazelcast.wan.map.useDeleteWhenProcessingRemoveEvents`
| false
| bool
| Configures WAN replication for `IMap` on the PASSIVE cluster to remove entries using delete instead of remove and when using `com.hazelcast.enterprise.wan.replication.WanBatchReplication` as an endpoint implementation. The member which receives the event batch in the PASSIVE cluster dispatches WAN events to the partition owners as map merge and remove operations. When using remove operations, the old entry value is sent from the partition owner to the caller even though the caller does not use the old value. This can also lead to issues if the PASSIVE cluster does not contain the class definition for the entry value as the value will try to get deserialized, causing `ClassNotFoundException`s. You can switch to using map remove instead on the PASSIVE cluster with this property. This will both save bandwidth and avoid the exception.
