This property sets the time window, in milliseconds, between the concurrency detection
and its notification. Normally in a concurrent system, the window
keeps sliding forward so it always remains concurrent.
Setting it too high effectively disables the optimization because once
a concurrency is detected it will keep that way. Setting it too low
could lead to suboptimal performance because the system
will try write through and other optimizations even though the system is concurrent.

events that match entry, update or exit from predicate value space.

|`hazelcast.map.expiry.delay.seconds`
|10
|int
|Delays expiration of backup map entries by the defined amount.
This may be useful to prevent some cases where an entry might be observed
on the primary replica (partition owner) but not on the backup replica.
For instance, when running an entry processor on both primary and backup replicas.

|`hazelcast.map.eviction.batch.size`
|1
|int
|Maximum number of IMap entries Hazelcast will evict during a
single eviction cycle. Eviction cycle is triggered by a map
mutation. Typically it is fine to evict at most a single entry.
However, when you insert values in a
loop, each iteration doubles the entry size. In this
situation more than just a single entry should be evicted.

|`hazelcast.map.invalidation.batchfrequency.seconds`
| 10
| int
|  If the collected invalidations do not reach the configured batch size, a background process sends them at this interval.

|`hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds`
| 60
| int
| Maximum timeout of heartbeat in seconds for a member to assume it is dead.

CAUTION: Setting this value too low may cause members to be evicted from the cluster when
they are under heavy load: they will be unable to send heartbeat operations in time, so other members will assume that it is dead.

|`hazelcast.max.wait.seconds.before.join`
| 20
| int
| Maximum wait time before join operation.
This is an upper limit on the cluster's pre-join phase duration. The pre-join
phase starts when the master receives the first join request, and ends after
no new members have tried to join for `hazelcast.wait.seconds.before.join`
seconds, or after this upper limit elapsed (whichever comes first). Once the
pre-join phase ends, the master moves into the join phase, during which it
will only admit members that have already tried joining during the pre-join
phase and are still trying to. Once the join phase is complete, the master
will again start admitting new members.

|`hazelcast.mc.executor.thread.count`

| true
| bool
| Defines whether the Moby naming should be used for generating instance
names when they are not provided by user. Moby name is a short human-readable
name consisting of a randomly chosen adjective and the surname of a famous person.

| int
| Initial run delay of <<split-brain-syndrome, split-brain/merge process>> in seconds.

|`hazelcast.merge.next.run.delay.seconds`
| 120
| int
| Run interval of <<split-brain-syndrome, split-brain/merge process>> in seconds.

|`hazelcast.metrics.collection.frequency`

the preferred way for controlling this setting is <<metrics-configuration, Metrics Configuration>>.

|`hazelcast.metrics.datastructures.enabled`
|true
|bool
| Specifies whether collecting metrics from the distributed data structures is enabled.

|`hazelcast.metrics.debug.enabled`
| false
| bool
| Enables collecting debug metrics if set to `true`, disables it otherwise.
Note that this is meant to be enabled only if diagnostics feature is enabled,
since currently only this feature consumes the debug metrics.

|`hazelcast.metrics.enabled`
| true
| bool
| Enables the <<metrics, metrics collection>> if set to `true`, disables it otherwise. Note that the preferred way for
controlling this setting is <<metrics-configuration, Metrics Configuration>>.

|`hazelcast.metrics.mc.enabled`
| true
| bool

| Duration, in seconds, that the <<metrics, metrics>> are retained for Management Center. Note that
the preferred way for controlling this setting is <<metrics-configuration, Metrics Configuration>>.

|`hazelcast.metrics.jmx.enabled`
| true
| bool
| Enables exposing the collected <<metrics, metrics>> over JMX if set to `true`, disables it otherwise. Note that
the preferred way for controlling this setting is <<metrics-configuration, Metrics Configuration>>.

|`hazelcast.network.stats.refresh.interval.seconds`
|3
|int
| Interval, in seconds, at which the network statistics (bytes sent and received)
are re-calculated and published. It is valid only when
<<advanced-network-configuration, advanced networking>> is used.

|`hazelcast.nio.tcp.spoofing.checks`
| false
| bool
| Controls whether more strict checks upon BIND requests towards a cluster member are applied.
The checks mainly validate the remote BIND request against the remote address as found in the socket.
By default they are disabled, to avoid connectivity issues when deployed under NAT'ed infrastructure.

|`hazelcast.operation.backup.timeout.millis`
|5000
|int
|Maximum time a caller to wait for backup responses of an operation.
After this timeout, operation response is returned to the caller even no backup response is received.

| 60000
| int
| Timeout to wait for a response when a remote call is sent, in milliseconds.

|`hazelcast.operation.fail.on.indeterminate.state`
| false
| bool
| When enabled, an operation fails with `IndeterminateOperationStateException`,
if it does not receive backup acks in time with respect to backup configuration of
its data structure, or the member which owns primary replica of the target partition leaves the cluster.

|`hazelcast.operation.generic.thread.count`
| -1
| int
| Number of generic operation handler threads. `-1` means CPU core count / 2.

|`hazelcast.operation.priority.generic.thread.count`
| 1
| int
| Number of priority generic operation handler threads per member.
Having at least 1 priority generic operation thread helps to improve
cluster stability since a lot of cluster operations are generic priority
operations and they should get executed as soon as possible. If there is
a dedicated generic operation thread then these operations don't get delayed
because the generic threads are busy executing regular user operations.
So unless memory consumption is an issue, make sure there is at least 1 thread.

|`hazelcast.operation.response.thread.count`
|2
|int
| Number of threads the process responses.
The default value gives stable and good performance.
If set to 0, the response threads are bypassed and the
response handling is done on the IO threads. Under certain
conditions this can give a higher throughput.

|`hazelcast.operation.responsequeue.idlestrategy`
|block
|string
|Specifies whether the response thread for internal operations on the member side are blocked or not.
If you use `block` (the default value) the thread is blocked and need to be notified which can cause
a reduction in the performance. If you use `backoff` there is no blocking.
By enabling the backoff mode and depending on your use case, you can get a 5-10% performance improvement.
However, keep in mind that this increases the CPU utilization.
We recommend you to use backoff with care and if you have a tool for measuring your cluster's performance.

|`hazelcast.operation.thread.count`
| -1
| int
| Number of partition based operation handler threads. `-1` means CPU core count.

|`hazelcast.partial.member.disconnection.resolution.algorithm.timeout.seconds`

|int
|Timeout, in seconds, to stop the execution of resolution algorithm when needed,
in the case of lots of possible random network disconnections especially
in the large clusters.

|`hazelcast.partial.member.disconnection.resolution.heartbeat.count`
|0
|int
|When the master (oldest member in the cluster) receives a heartbeat
problem report from another member, it first waits for a number
of heartbeat rounds to allow other members
to report their problems, if there is any. This property sets the number
of these rounds.

|`hazelcast.partition.backup.sync.interval`
|30
|int
|Interval for syncing backup replicas in seconds.

|`hazelcast.partition.count`
| 271
| int
| Total partition count.

|`hazelcast.partition.max.parallel.migrations`
|5
|int
|Maximum number of partition migrations to be executed on a member. Member can be either source or target of the migration.
This parameter limits the maximum running migration operations in parallel on a single member.

    * Having too much parallelization can increase the heap memory usage and overload the network during partition rebalance.
    * Having less parallelization can increase the total migration completion time.

|`hazelcast.partition.max.parallel.replications`
|10
|int
|Maximum number of anti-entropy partition replications to be executed on a member.
When a partition backup ownership changes or a backup inconsistency is detected, the members start to sync their backup partitions.
This parameter limits the maximum running replication operations in parallel.
Default value is equal to `hazelcast.partition.max.parallel.migrations`.

|`hazelcast.partition.migration.fragments.enabled`
| true
| bool
| When enabled, which is the default behavior, partitions are migrated/replicated in small fragments instead of one big chunk.
Migrating partitions in fragments reduces pressure on the memory and network
since smaller packets are created in the memory and sent through the network.
Note that it can increase the migration time to complete.

|`hazelcast.partition.migration.interval`
| 0
| int
| Interval to run partition migration tasks in seconds.

|`hazelcast.partition.migration.stale.read.disabled`
| false
| bool
| Hazelcast allows read operations to be performed while a partition is being migrated.
This can lead to stale reads for some scenarios.
You can disable stale read operations by setting this system property's value to "true".
Its default value is "false", meaning that stale reads are allowed.

|`hazelcast.partition.migration.timeout`
| 300
| int
| Timeout for partition migration tasks in seconds.

|int
|Maximum value of local partitions to trigger local pre-check for `Predicates#alwaysTrue()`
query operations on maps.

|`hazelcast.query.optimizer.type`
|RULES
|String
|Type of the query optimizer. For optimizations based on static rules, set the value to `RULES`.
To disable the optimization, set the value to `NONE`.

|[[parallel-predicates]] `hazelcast.query.predicate.parallel.evaluation`
|false
|bool
|Each Hazelcast member evaluates query predicates using a single thread by default.
In most cases, the overhead of inter-thread communications overweight can benefit from parallel execution.
When you have a large dataset and/or slow predicate, you may benefit from parallel predicate evaluations.
Set to `true` if you are using slow predicates or have > 100,000s entries per member.

|`hazelcast.query.result.size.limit`
|-1
|int
|Result size limit for query operations on maps.
This value defines the maximum number of returned elements for a single query result.
If a query exceeds this number of elements, a QueryResultSizeExceededException is thrown.
Its default value is -1, meaning it is disabled.

|`hazelcast.serialization.version`
|
|long
|Version of the Hazelcast serialization. Accepted values are between 1 and
the highest supported serialization version.

|`hazelcast.shutdownhook.enabled`
| true

| Specifies the behavior when JVM is exiting while the Hazelcast instance is still running.
It has two values: TERMINATE and GRACEFUL. The former one terminates the Hazelcast instance immediately.
The latter, GRACEFUL, initiates the graceful shutdown which can significantly slow down the JVM exit process, but it tries to retain data safety.
Note that you should always shutdown Hazelcast explicitly via using the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`.
It's not recommended to rely on the shutdown hook, this is a last-effort measure.

|`hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.enabled`
|true
|bool
|Enables/disables the <<slowoperationdetector, SlowOperationDetector>>.

|`hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.log.purge.interval.seconds`
|300
|int
|Purge interval for slow operation logs.

|`hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.log.retention.seconds`
|3600
|int
|Defines the retention time of invocations in slow operation logs.
If an invocation is older than this value, it is purged from the log to prevent unlimited memory usage.
When all invocations are purged from a log, the log itself is deleted.

|`hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.stacktrace.logging.enabled`
|false
|bool
|Defines if the stacktraces of slow operations are logged in the log file.
Stack traces are always reported to the Management Center, but by default, they are not printed to keep the log size small.

|`hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.threshold.millis`
|10000
|int
|Defines a threshold above which a running operation in `OperationService` is considered to be slow.
These operations log a warning and are shown in the Management Center with detailed information, e.g., stacktrace.

|`hazelcast.socket.bind.any`
| true
| bool
| Bind both server-socket and client-sockets to any local interface.

|`hazelcast.socket.buffer.direct`
| false
| bool
| Specifies whether the byte buffers used in the socket should be a direct byte buffer (`true`) or a regular one (`false`).
When it is set to `true`, Hazelcast internally uses the method `ByteBuffer.allocateDirect` (instead of `ByteBuffer.allocate`) which makes use of
the off-heap and may skip the memory copying when performing socket I/O operations.
See link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html[here^] for more information.

|`hazelcast.socket.client.bind`
|true
|bool
|Bind client socket to an interface when connecting to a remote server socket.
When set to `false`, client socket is not bound to any interface.

|`hazelcast.socket.client.bind.any`
| true
| bool
| Bind client-sockets to any local interface. If not set, `hazelcast.socket.bind.any` is used as the default.

|`hazelcast.socket.client.receive.buffer.size`
|-1
|int
|Hazelcast creates all connections with receive buffer size set according to the `hazelcast.socket.receive.buffer.size`.
When it detects a connection opened by a client, then it adjusts the receive buffer size according to this property.
It is in kilobytes and its default value is -1.

|`hazelcast.socket.client.send.buffer.size`
|-1
|int
|Hazelcast creates all connections with send buffer size set according to the `hazelcast.socket.send.buffer.size`.
When it detects a connection opened by a client, then it adjusts the send buffer size according to this property.
It is in kilobytes and its  default value is -1.

|`hazelcast.socket.connect.timeout.seconds`
|0
|int
|Socket connection timeout in seconds. `Socket.connect()` is blocked until
either connection is established or connection is refused or this timeout passes.
Default is 0, means infinite.

|`hazelcast.socket.keep.alive`
| true
| bool
| Socket set keep alive (`SO_KEEPALIVE`).

|`hazelcast.socket.linger.seconds`
|0
|int
|Set socket `SO_LINGER` option.

|`hazelcast.socket.no.delay`
| true
| bool
| Socket set TCP no delay.

|`hazelcast.socket.receive.buffer.size`
| 128
| int
| Socket receive buffer (`SO_RCVBUF`) size in KB.
If you have a very fast network, e.g., 10gbit) and/or you have large entries, then you may benefit from increasing sender/receiver buffer sizes.
Use this property and the next one below tune the size.

|`hazelcast.socket.send.buffer.size`
| 128
| int
| Socket send buffer (`SO_SNDBUF`) size in KB.

|`hazelcast.socket.server.bind.any`
| true
| bool
| Bind server-socket to any local interface. If not set, `hazelcast.socket.bind.any` is used as the default.

|`hazelcast.tcp.join.port.try.count`
|3
|int
|The number of incremental ports, starting with the port number defined in the network configuration,
that is used to connect to a host (which is defined without a port in TCP/IP member list while a member is searching for a cluster).

|`hazelcast.wait.seconds.before.join`
| 5
| int
| Wait time before join operation.
This time establishes a pre-join phase time window for newcomer members to
make their first join requests. Once `hazelcast.wait.seconds.before.join`
elapses since the last first-timer join request (i.e., where the member hasn't
made any previous join request), or the pre-join phase has lasted for
`hazelcast.max.wait.seconds.before.join` seconds, the phase ends and the
master starts forming the cluster.
