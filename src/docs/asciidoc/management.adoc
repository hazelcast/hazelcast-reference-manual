== Management

This chapter provides information on managing and monitoring your Hazelcast cluster. It gives detailed instructions related to gathering statistics, monitoring via JMX protocol and managing the cluster with useful utilities.


=== Getting Member Statistics

You can get various statistics from your distributed data structures via the Statistics API.
Since the data structures are distributed in the cluster, the Statistics API provides
statistics for the local portion (1/Number of Members in the Cluster) of data on each member.

==== Map Statistics

To get local map statistics, use the `getLocalMapStats()` method from the `IMap` interface. This method returns a
`LocalMapStats` object that holds local map statistics.

Below is an example code where the `getLocalMapStats()` method and the `getOwnedEntryCount()` method get the number of entries owned by this member.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/management/SampleLocalMapStats.java[tag=lms]
----

NOTE: Since Hazelcast IMDG 3.8 `getOwnedEntryMemoryCost()` method is now supported for NATIVE in-memory format as well.

The following are some of the metrics that you can access via the `LocalMapStats` object.

* Number of entries owned by the member (`getOwnedEntryCount()`).
* Number of backup entries hold by the member (`getBackupEntryCount()`).
* Number of backups per entry (`getBackupCount()`).
* Memory cost (number of bytes) of owned entries in the member (`getOwnedEntryMemoryCost()`).
* Creation time of the map on the member (`getCreationTime()`).
* Number of hits (reads) of the locally owned entries (`getHits()`).
* Number of get and put operations on the map (`getPutOperationCount()` and `getGetOperationCount()`).
* Number of queries executed on the map (`getQueryCount()` and `getIndexedQueryCount()`). May be imprecise for queries involving partition predicates (`PartitionPredicate`) on off-heap storage.

Please refer to http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/monitor/LocalMapStats.html[`LocalMapStats` Javadoc] to see all the metrics.

==== Map Index Statistics

To access map index statistics, if you are using indexes to speed up map queries, use the `getIndexStats()` method of the `LocalMapStats` interface returned by `IMap.getLocalMapStats()`.

Below is an example where the `getIndexStats()` method is used to examine an average selectivity of index hits:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/management/SampleLocalIndexStats.java[tag=lis]
----

The following are some of the metrics that you can obtain via the `LocalIndexStats` interface:

* Number of queries and hits into an index (`getQueryCount()` and `getHitCount()`). Number of hits and queries may differ since a single query may hit the same index more than once.

* Average index hit latency measured in nanoseconds (`getAverageHitLatency()`).

* Average index hit selectivity (`getAverageHitSelectivity`). Returned values are in the range from 0.0 to 1.0. Values close to 1.0 indicate a high selectivity meaning the index is efficient; values close to 0.0 indicate a low selectivity meaning the index efficiency is approaching an efficiency of a simple full scan.

* Number of index insert, update and remove operations (`getInsertCount()`, `getUpdateCount()` and `getRemoveCount()`).

* Total latencies of insert, update and remove operations (`getTotalInsertLatency()`, `getTotalUpdateLatency()`, `getTotalRemoveLatency()`). To compute an average latency divide the returned value by the number of operations of a corresponding type.

* Memory cost of an index (`getMemoryCost()`). For on-heap storages, this memory cost metric value is a best-effort approximation and doesn't indicate a precise on-heap memory usage of an index.

Refer to http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/monitor/LocalIndexStats.html[`LocalIndexStats` Javadoc] to see all the metrics.

To compute an aggregated value of `getAverageHitSelectivity()` for all cluster members, you can use a simple averaging computation as shown below:

```
(s(1) + s(2) + ... + s(n)) / n
```

In this computation, `s(i)` is an average hit selectivity on the member `i` and `n` is the total number of cluster members.

A more advanced solution is to compute a weighted average as shown below:

```
(s(1) * h(1) + s(2) * h(2) + ... + s(n) * h(n)) / (h(1) + h(2) + ... + h(n))
```

Here, `s(i)` is an average hit selectivity on the member `i`, `h(i)` is a hit count (`getHitCount()`) on the member `i` and `n` is the total number of cluster members. This more advanced solution may produce more precise results in unstable dynamic clusters where new members do not have enough statistics accumulated. The same technique may be applied to the `getAverageHitLatency()` metric.

Accuracy and reliability notes:

* Values returned by `getAverageHitSelectivity()` have an accuracy of around 1% for on-heap storages.
* Values returned by `getQueryCount()` and `getHitCount()` may be imprecise for queries involving partition predicates (`PartitionPredicate`) on off-heap storage.
* Index statistics may be imprecise after a new cluster member addition or the existing member removal until enough fresh statistics is accumulated on a new owner of an index or its partition.

==== Near Cache Statistics

To get Near Cache statistics, use the `getNearCacheStats()` method from the `LocalMapStats` object.
This method returns a `NearCacheStats` object that holds Near Cache statistics.

Below is an example code where the `getNearCacheStats()` method and the `getRatio` method from `NearCacheStats` get a Near Cache hit/miss ratio.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/management/SampleNearCacheStats.java[tag=ncs]
----

The following are some of the metrics that you can access via the `NearCacheStats` object.
This behavior applies to both client and member Near Caches.

* Creation time of the Near Cache map on the member (`getCreationTime()`).
* Number of entries owned by the member (`getOwnedEntryCount()`).
* Memory cost (number of bytes) of owned entries in the Near Cache (`getOwnedEntryMemoryCost()`).
* Number of hits (reads) of the locally owned entries (`getHits()`).

Please refer to http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/monitor/NearCacheStats.html[`NearCacheStats` Javadoc] to see all the metrics.


==== Multimap Statistics

To get MultiMap statistics, use the `getLocalMultiMapStats()` method from the `MultiMap` interface.
This method returns a `LocalMultiMapStats` object that holds local MultiMap statistics.

Below is an example code where the `getLocalMultiMapStats()` method and the `getLastUpdateTime` method from `LocalMultiMapStats` get the last update time.

=== Monitoring with JMX

You can monitor your Hazelcast members via the JMX protocol.

To achieve this, first add the following system properties to enable http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/agent.html[JMX agent]:

* `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote`
* `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=\_portNo\_` (to specify JMX port, the default is `1099`) (*optional*)
* `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false` (to disable JMX auth) (*optional*)


Then enable the Hazelcast property `hazelcast.jmx` (please refer to the <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>>) using one of the following ways:

* By declarative configuration:
+
```
<properties>
   <property name="hazelcast.jmx">true</property>
</properties>
```
+
* By programmatic configuration:
+
`config.setProperty("hazelcast.jmx", "true");`
+
* By Spring XML configuration:
+
```
<hz:properties>
  <hz: property name="hazelcast.jmx">true</hz:property>
</hz:properties>
```
+
* By setting the system property `-Dhazelcast.jmx=true`


==== MBean Naming for Hazelcast Data Structures

Hazelcast set the naming convention for MBeans as follows:

```
final ObjectName mapMBeanName = new ObjectName("com.hazelcast:instance=_hzInstance_1_dev,type=IMap,name=trial");
```

The MBeans name consists of the Hazelcast instance name, the type of the data structure and that data structure's name. In the above sample, `_hzInstance_1_dev` is the instance name, we connect to an IMap with the name `trial`.



==== Connecting to JMX Agent

One of the ways you can connect to JMX agent is using jconsole, jvisualvm (with MBean plugin) or another JMX compliant monitoring tool.

The other way to connect is to use a custom JMX client.

First, you need to specify the URL where the Hazelcast JMX service is running. Please see the following sample code snippet. The `port` in this sample should be the one that you define while setting the JMX remote port number (if different than the default port `1099`).


[source,java]
----
// Parameters for connecting to the JMX Service
int port = 1099;
String hostname = InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName();
JMXServiceURL url = new JMXServiceURL("service:jmx:rmi://" + hostname + ":" + port + "/jndi/rmi://" + hostname + ":" + port + "/jmxrmi");
----

Then use the URL you acquired to connect to the JMX service and get the `JMXConnector` object. Using this object, get the `MBeanServerConnection` object. The `MBeanServerConnection` object will enable you to use the MBean methods. Please see the example code below.


[source,java]
----
// Connect to the JMX Service
JMXConnector jmxc = JMXConnectorFactory.connect(url, null);
MBeanServerConnection mbsc = jmxc.getMBeanServerConnection();
----

Once you get the `MBeanServerConnection` object, you can call the getter methods of MBeans as follows:

```
System.out.println("\nTotal entries on map " + mbsc.getAttribute(mapMBeanName, "name") + " : "
                + mbsc.getAttribute(mapMBeanName, "localOwnedEntryCount"));
```

=== Cluster Utilities

This section provides information on programmatic utilities you can use to listen to the cluster events, to change the state of your cluster, to check whether the cluster and/or members are safe before shutting down a member and to define the minimum number of cluster members required for the cluster to remain up and running. It also gives information on the Hazelcast Lite Member.

==== Getting Member Events and Member Sets

Hazelcast allows you to register for membership events so you will be notified when members are added or removed. You can also get the set of cluster members.

The following example code does the above: registers for member events, notifies when members are added or removed and gets the set of cluster members.

[source,java]
----
public class SampleGetMemberEventsAndSets {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        Cluster cluster = hazelcastInstance.getCluster();
        cluster.addMembershipListener( new MembershipListener() {
            public void memberAdded( MembershipEvent membershipEvent ) {
                System.out.println( "MemberAdded " + membershipEvent );
            }

            public void memberRemoved( MembershipEvent membershipEvent ) {
                System.out.println( "MemberRemoved " + membershipEvent );
            }
        } );

        Member localMember  = cluster.getLocalMember();
        System.out.println ( "my inetAddress= " + localMember.getInetAddress() );

        Set setMembers  = cluster.getMembers();
        for ( Member member : setMembers ) {
            System.out.println( "isLocalMember " + member.localMember() );
            System.out.println( "member.inetaddress " + member.getInetAddress() );
            System.out.println( "member.port " + member.getPort() );
        }
    }
}
----

NOTE: Please refer to the <<listening-for-member-events, Membership Listener section>> for more information on membership events.

==== Managing Cluster and Member States

Starting with Hazelcast 3.6, Hazelcast introduces cluster and member states in addition to the default `ACTIVE` state. This section explains these states of Hazelcast clusters and members which you can use to allow or restrict the designated cluster/member operations.

===== Cluster States

By changing the state of your cluster, you can allow/restrict several cluster operations or change the behavior of those operations. You can use the methods `changeClusterState()` and `shutdown()` which are in the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/Cluster.html[Cluster interface] to change your cluster's state.

Hazelcast clusters have the following states:

* **`ACTIVE`**: This is the default cluster state. Cluster continues to operate without restrictions.
* **`NO_MIGRATION`**:
** In this state, migrations (partition rebalancing) and backup replications are not allowed. In other words, there will be no data movement between Hazelcast members. However, in case of member failures, backup replicas can be still promoted to the primaries to maintain availability and migration listeners can be notified for these promotion migrations. Please note that promoting a backup replica to the primary replica is a local operation and does not transfer partition data between Hazelcast members.
** The cluster accepts new members.
** All other operations are allowed.
** You cannot change the state of a cluster to `NO_MIGRATION` when migration/replication tasks are being performed.
** When you want to add multiple new members to the cluster, you can first change the cluster state to `NO_MIGRATION`, then start the new members. Once all of them join to the cluster, you can change the cluster state back to `ACTIVE`. Then, the cluster will rebalance partition replica distribution at once.
* **`FROZEN`**:
** In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed.
** The cluster does not accept new members.
** If a member leaves, it can join back. Its partition assignments (both primary and backup replicas) remain the same until either it joins back or the cluster state is changed to `ACTIVE`. When it joins back to the cluster, it will own all previous partition assignments as it was. On the other hand, when the cluster state changes to `ACTIVE`, re-partitioning starts and unassigned partition replicas are assigned to the active members.
** All other operations in the cluster, except migration, continue without restrictions.
** You cannot change the state of a cluster to `FROZEN` when migration/replication tasks are being performed.
** You can make use of `FROZEN` state along with the <<hot-restart-persistence, Hot Restart Persistence>> feature. You can change the cluster state to `FROZEN`, then restart some of your members using the Hot Restart feature. The data on the restarting members will not be accessible but you will be able to access to the data that is stored in other members. Basically, `FROZEN` cluster state allows you do perform maintenance on your members with degrading availability partially.
* **`PASSIVE`**:
** In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed.
** The cluster does not accept new members.
** If a member leaves while the cluster is in this state, the member will be removed from the partition table if cluster state moves back to `ACTIVE`.
** This state rejects ALL operations immediately EXCEPT the read-only operations like `map.get()` and `cache.get()`, replication and cluster heartbeat tasks.
** You cannot change the state of a cluster to `PASSIVE` when migration/replication tasks are being performed.
** You can make use of `PASSIVE` state along with the <<hot-restart-persistence, Hot Restart Persistence>> feature. Please see http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/Cluster.html#shutdown--[Cluster Shutdown API] for more info.
* **`IN_TRANSITION`**:
** This state shows that the state of the cluster is in transition.
** You cannot set your cluster's state as `IN_TRANSITION` explicitly.
** It is a temporary and intermediate state.
** During this state, your cluster does not accept new members and migration/replication tasks are paused.


NOTE: All in-cluster methods are fail-fast, i.e., when a method fails in the cluster, it throws an exception immediately (it will not be retried).


The following snippet is from the `Cluster` interface showing the methods used to manage your cluster's states.


```
public interface Cluster {
...
...
    ClusterState getClusterState();
    void changeClusterState(ClusterState newState);
    void changeClusterState(ClusterState newState, TransactionOptions transactionOptions);
    void shutdown();
    void shutdown(TransactionOptions transactionOptions);
```

Please refer to the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/Cluster.html[Cluster interface] for information on these methods.

===== Cluster Member States

Hazelcast cluster members have the following states:

* **`ACTIVE`**: This is the initial member state. The member can execute and process all operations. When the state of the cluster is `ACTIVE` or `FROZEN`, the members are in the `ACTIVE` state.
* **`PASSIVE`**: In this state, member rejects all operations EXCEPT the read-only ones, replication and migration operations, heartbeat operations and the join operations as explained in the <<cluster-states, Cluster States section>> above. A member can go into this state when either of the following happens:
. Until the member's shutdown process is completed after the method `Node.shutdown(boolean)` is called. Note that, when the shutdown process is completed, member's state changes to `SHUT_DOWN`.
. Cluster's state is changed to `PASSIVE` using the method `changeClusterState()`.
* **`SHUT_DOWN`**: A member goes into this state when the member's shutdown process is completed. The member in this state rejects all operations and invocations. A member in this state cannot be restarted.


==== Using the Script cluster.sh

You can use the script `cluster.sh`, which comes with the Hazelcast package, to get/change the state of your cluster, to shutdown your cluster and to force your cluster to clean its persisted data and make a fresh start. The latter is the Force Start operation of Hazelcast's Hot Restart Persistence feature. Please refer to the <<force-start, Force Start section>>.

NOTE: The script `cluster.sh` uses `curl` command and `curl` must be installed to be able to use the script.


The script `cluster.sh` needs the following parameters to operate according to your needs. If these parameters are not provided, the default values are used.

[cols="2,2,5a"]
|===
|Parameter | Default Value | Description

|`-o` or `--operation`
|`get-state`
|Executes a cluster-wide operation. Operations can be the following:

* IMDG Open Source operations: `get-state`, `change-state`, `shutdown` and `get-cluster-version`.
* IMDG Enterprise operations: `force-start`, `partial-start` and `change-cluster-version`.

|`-s` or `--state`
|None
|Updates the state of the cluster to a new state. New state can be `active`, `no_migration`, `frozen`, `passive`. This is used with the operation `change-state`. This parameter has no default value; when you use this, you should provide a valid state.

|`-a` or `--address`
|`127.0.0.1`
|Defines the IP address of a cluster member. If you want to manage your cluster remotely, you should use this parameter to provide the IP address of a member to this script.

|`-p` or `--port`
|`5701`
|Defines on which port Hazelcast is running on the local or remote machine. Its default value is `5701`.

|`-g` or `--groupname`
|`dev`
|Defines the name of a cluster group which is used for a simple authentication. Please see the <<creating-cluster-groups, Creating Cluster Groups section>>.

|`-P` or `--password`
|`dev-pass`
|Defines the password of a cluster group (valid only for Hazelcast releases older than 3.8.2). Please see the <<creating-cluster-groups, Creating Cluster Groups section>>.

|`-v` or `--version`
|None
|Defines the cluster version to change to. To be used in conjunction with `change-cluster-version` operation.
|===

The script `cluster.sh` is self-documented; you can see the parameter descriptions using the command `sh cluster.sh -h` or `sh cluster.sh --help`.

NOTE: You can perform the above operations using the Hot Restart tab of Hazelcast Management Center or using the REST API. Please see the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#hot-restart[Hot Restart] and <<using-rest-api-for-cluster-management, Using REST API for Cluster Management>>.


===== Example Usages for cluster.sh

Let's say you have a cluster running on remote machines and one Hazelcast member is running on the IP  `172.16.254.1` and on the port
`5702`. The group name and password of the cluster are `test` and `test`.

**Getting the cluster state:**

To get the state of the cluster, use the following command:

`sh cluster.sh -o get-state -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

The following also gets the cluster state, using the alternative parameter names, e.g., `--port` instead of `-p`:

`sh cluster.sh --operation get-state --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --groupname test --password test`

**Changing the cluster state:**

To change the state of the cluster to `frozen`, use the following command:

`sh cluster.sh -o change-state -s frozen -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

Similarly, you can use the following command for the same purpose:

`sh cluster.sh --operation change-state --state frozen --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --groupname test --password test`

**Shutting down the cluster:**

To shutdown the cluster, use the following command:

`sh cluster.sh -o shutdown -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

Similarly, you can use the following command for the same purpose:


`sh cluster.sh --operation shutdown --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --groupname test --password test`


**Partial starting the cluster:**

To partial start the cluster when Hot Restart is enabled, use the following command:

`sh cluster.sh -o partial-start -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

Similarly, you can use the following command for the same purpose:

`sh cluster.sh --operation partial-start --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --groupname test --password test`


**Force starting the cluster:**

To force start the cluster when Hot Restart is enabled, use the following command:

`sh cluster.sh -o force-start -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

Similarly, you can use the following command for the same purpose:

`sh cluster.sh --operation force-start --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --groupname test --password test`


**Getting the current cluster version:**

To get the cluster version, use the following command:

`sh cluster.sh -o get-cluster-version -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

The following also gets the cluster state, using the alternative parameter names, e.g., `--port` instead of `-p`:

`sh cluster.sh --operation get-cluster-version --address 172.16.254.1 --port 5702 --groupname test --password test`


**Changing cluster version:**

Learn more about when you should change the cluster version in <<rolling-member-upgrades, Rolling Member Upgrades chapter>>.

To change the cluster version to `3.9`, use the following command:

`sh cluster.sh -o change-cluster-version -v 3.9 -a 172.16.254.1 -p 5702 -g test -P test`

Cluster version is always in `major.minor` format, using other formats will result in a failure.

NOTE: Currently, this script is not supported on the Windows platforms.


==== Using REST API for Cluster Management

Besides the Management Center's Hot Restart http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#hot-restart[tab] and the script <<using-the-script-cluster-sh, `cluster.sh`>>, you can also use REST API to manage your cluster's state. The following are the operations you can perform.

|===


==== Enabling Lite Members

Lite members are the Hazelcast cluster members that do not store data. These members are used mainly to execute tasks and register listeners and they do not have partitions.

You can form your cluster to include the regular Hazelcast members to store data and Hazelcast lite members to run heavy computations. The presence of the lite members do not affect the operations performed on the other members in the cluster. You can directly submit your tasks to the lite members, register listeners on them and invoke operations for the Hazelcast data structures on them such as `map.put()` and `map.get()`.

===== Configuring Lite Members

You can enable a cluster member to be a lite member using declarative or programmatic configuration.

**Declarative Configuration:**

```
<hazelcast>
    <lite-member enabled="true">
</hazelcast>
```

**Programmatic Configuration:**

```
Config config = new Config();
config.setLiteMember(true);
```

===== Promoting Lite Members to Data Member

Lite members can be promoted to data members using the `Cluster` interface. When they are promoted, cluster partitions are rebalanced and ownerships of some portion of the partitions are assigned to the newly promoted data members.

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
config.setLiteMember(true);

HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
Cluster cluster = hazelcastInstance.getCluster();
cluster.promoteLocalLiteMember();
----

NOTE: A data member cannot be downgraded to a lite member back.


==== Defining Member Attributes

You can define various member attributes on your Hazelcast members. You can use these member attributes to tag your members as your business logic requirements.

To define member attribute on a member, you can either:

* provide `MemberAttributeConfig` to your `Config` object,
* or provide member attributes at runtime via attribute setter methods on the `Member` interface.

For example, you can tag your members with their CPU characteristics and you can route CPU intensive tasks to those CPU-rich members:

[source,java]
----
public class SampleMemberAttributes {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MemberAttributeConfig fourCore = new MemberAttributeConfig();
        memberAttributeConfig.setIntAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT", 4 );
        MemberAttributeConfig twelveCore = new MemberAttributeConfig();
        memberAttributeConfig.setIntAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT", 12 );
        MemberAttributeConfig twentyFourCore = new MemberAttributeConfig();
        memberAttributeConfig.setIntAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT", 24 );

        Config member1Config = new Config();
        config.setMemberAttributeConfig( fourCore );
        Config member2Config = new Config();
        config.setMemberAttributeConfig( twelveCore );
        Config member3Config = new Config();
        config.setMemberAttributeConfig( twentyFourCore );

        HazelcastInstance member1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( member1Config );
        HazelcastInstance member2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( member2Config );
        HazelcastInstance member3 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( member3Config );

        IExecutorService executorService = member1.getExecutorService( "processor" );

        executorService.execute( new CPUIntensiveTask(), new MemberSelector() {
            @Override
            public boolean select(Member member) {
                int coreCount = (int) member.getIntAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT" );
                // Task will be executed at either member2 or member3
                if ( coreCount > 8 ) {
                    return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
        } );

        HazelcastInstance member4 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        // We can also set member attributes at runtime.
        member4.setIntAttribute( "CPU_CORE_COUNT", 2 );
    }
}
----

For another example, you can tag some members with a filter so that a member in the cluster can load classes from those tagged members. Please see the <<member-user-code-deployment-beta, User Code Deployment section>> for more information.

You can also configure your member attributes through declarative configuration and start your member afterwards. Here is how you can use the declarative approach:

```
<member-attributes>
  <attribute name="CPU_CORE_COUNT">4</attribute-name>
</member-attributes>
```

==== Safety Checking Cluster Members

To prevent data loss when shutting down a cluster member, Hazelcast provides a graceful shutdown feature. You perform this shutdown by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`.

Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, the master member migrates all of the replicas owned by the shutdown-requesting member to the other running (not initiated shutdown) cluster members. After these migrations are completed, the shutting down member will not be the owner or a backup of any partition anymore. It means that you can shutdown any number of Hazelcast members in a cluster concurrently with no data loss.

Please note that the process of shutting down members waits for a predefined amount of time for the master to migrate their partition replicas. You can specify this graceful shutdown timeout duration using the property `hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait`. Its default value is 10 minutes. If migrations are not completed within this duration, shutdown may continue non-gracefully and lead to data loss. Therefore, you should choose your own timeout duration considering the size of data in your cluster.

===== Ensuring Safe State with PartitionService

With the improvements in graceful shutdown procedure in Hazelcast 3.7, the following methods are not needed to perform graceful shutdown. Nevertheless, you can use them to check the current safety status of the partitions in your cluster.


```
public interface PartitionService {
   ...
   ...
    boolean isClusterSafe();
    boolean isMemberSafe(Member member);
    boolean isLocalMemberSafe();
    boolean forceLocalMemberToBeSafe(long timeout, TimeUnit unit);
}
```

The method `isClusterSafe` checks whether the cluster is in a safe state. It returns `true` if there are no active partition migrations and all backups are in sync for each partition.

The method `isMemberSafe` checks whether a specific member is in a safe state. It checks if all backups of partitions of the given member are in sync with the primary ones. Once it returns `true`, the given member is safe and it can be shut down without data loss.

Similarly, the method `isLocalMemberSafe` does the same check for the local member. The method `forceLocalMemberToBeSafe` forces the owned and backup partitions to be synchronized, making the local member safe.

NOTE: If you want to use the above methods, please note that they are available starting with Hazelcast 3.3.

NOTE: For more code samples please refer to https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/monitoring/cluster-safety[PartitionService Code Samples].


=== Diagnostics

Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, Hazelcast offers an extended set of diagnostics plugins for both Hazelcast members and clients. A dedicated log file is used to write the diagnostics content, and a rolling file approach is used to prevent taking up too much disk space.

==== Enabling Diagnostics Logging

To enable diagnostics logging, you should specify the following properties an the member side:

```
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.enabled=true
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.metric.level=info
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.invocation.sample.period.seconds=30
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.pending.invocations.period.seconds=30
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.slowoperations.period.seconds=30
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.storeLatency.period.seconds=60
```

At the client side you should specify the following properties:

```
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.enabled=true
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.metric.level=info
```

==== Diagnostics Log File

You can use the following property to specify the location of the diagnostics log file:

```
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.directory=/your/log/directory
```

The name of the log file has the following format:

```
diagnostics-<host IP>#<port>-<unique ID>.log
```

The name of the log file can be prefixed with a custom string as shown below:

```
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.filename.prefix=foobar
```

The content format of the diagnostics log file is depicted below:

```
<Date> BuildInfo[
	<log content for BuildInfo diagnostics plugin>]
<Date> SystemProperties[
	<log content for SystemProperties diagnostics plugin>]
<Date> ConfigProperties[
	<log content for ConfigProperties diagnostics plugin>]
<Date> Metrics[
	<log content for Metrics diagnostics plugin>]
<Date> SlowOperations[
	<log content for SlowOperations diagnostics plugin>]
<Date> HazelcastInstance[
	<log content for HazelcastInstance diagnostics plugin>]
...
...
...
```

A rolling file approach is used to prevent creating too much data. By default 10 files of 50MB each are allowed
to exist. The size of the file can be changed using the following property:

```
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.max.rolled.file.size.mb=100
```

You can also set the number of files using the following property:

```
-Dhazelcast.diagnostics.max.rolled.file.count=5
```

In Hazelcast 3.9 the default file size has been upgraded from 10MB to 50MB.

==== Diagnostics Plugins

As it is stated in the introduction of this section and shown in the log file content above, diagnostics utility consists of plugins such as BuildInfo, SystemProperties and HazelcastInstance.

===== BuildInfo

It shows the detailed Hazelcast build information including the Hazelcast release number, `Git` revision number and whether you have Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise or not.

===== SystemProperties

It shows all the properties and their values in your system used by and configured for your Hazelcast installation. These are the properties starting with `java` (excluding `java.awt`), `hazelcast`, `sun` and `os`. It also includes the arguments that are used to startup the JVM.

===== ConfigProperties

It shows the Hazelcast properties and their values explicitly set by you either on the command line (with `-D`) or by using declarative/programmatic configuration.

===== Metrics

It shows a comprehensive log of what is happening in your Hazelcast system.

You can configure the level of detail and frequency of dumping information to the log file using the following properties:

* `hazelcast.diagnostics.metrics.period.seconds`: Set a value in seconds. Its default value is `60` seconds.
* `hazelcast.diagnostics.metrics.level`: Set a level. It can be `Mandatory`, `Info` and `Debug`. Its default value is `Mandatory`.

===== SlowOperations

It shows the slow operations and invocations, Please refer to <<slowoperationdetector , SlowOperationDetector>> for more information.

===== Invocations

It shows all kinds of statistics about current and past invocations including current pending invocations, history of invocations and slow history, i.e. all samples where the invocation took more than the defined threshold.  Slow history does not only include the invocations where the operations took a lot of time, but it also includes any other invocations that have been obstructed.

Using the following properties, you can configure the frequency of scanning all pending invocations and the threshold that makes an invocation to be considered as slow:

* `hazelcast.diagnostics.invocation.sample.period.seconds`: Set a value in seconds. Its default value is `60` seconds.
* `hazelcast.diagnostics.invocation.slow.threshold.seconds`: Set a value in seconds. Its default value is `5` seconds.

===== HazelcastInstance

It shows the basic state of your Hazelcast cluster including the count and addresses of current members and the address of master member. It is useful to get a fast impression of the cluster without needing to analyze a lot of data.

You can configure the frequency at which the cluster information is dumped to the log file using the following property:

* `hazelcast.diagnostics.memberinfo.period.second`: Set a value in seconds. Its default value is `60` seconds.

===== SystemLog

It shows the activities in your cluster including when a connection/member is added or removed and if there is a change in the lifecycle of the cluster. It also includes the reasons for connection closings.

You can enable or disable the system log diagnostics plugin, and configure whether it shows information about partition migrations using the following properties:

* `hazelcast.diagnostics.systemlog.enabled`: Its default value is `true`.
* `hazelcast.diagnostics.systemlog.partitions`: Its default value is `false`. Please note that if you enable this, you may get a lot of log entries if you have many partitions.


===== StoreLatency

It shows statistics including the count of methods for each store (`load`, `loadAll`, `loadAllKeys`, etc.), average and maximum latencies for each store method calls and latency distributions for each store. The following is an example output snippet as part of the diagnostics log file for Hazelcast MapStore:

```
17-9-2016 13:12:34 MapStoreLatency[
              map[
                 loadAllKeys[
                    count=1
                    totalTime(us)=8
                    avg(us)=8
                    max(us)=8
                    latency-distribution[
                    0..99us=1]]
                 load[
                    count=100
                    totalTime(us)=4,632,190
                    avg(us)=46,321
                    max(us)=99,178
                    latency-distribution[
                           0..99us=1
                           1600..3199us=3
                           3200..6399us=3
                           6400..12799us=7
                           12800..25599us=13
                           25600..51199us=32
                           51200..102399us=41]]]]
```

According to your store usage, a similar output can be seen for Hazelcast JCache, Queue and Ringbuffer with persistent datastores.

You can control the StoreLatency plugin using the following properties:

- `hazelcast.diagnostics.storeLatency.period.seconds`: The frequency this plugin is writing the collected information to the disk. By default it is disabled. A sensible production value would be `60` seconds.
- `hazelcast.diagnostics.storeLatency.reset.period.seconds`: The period of resetting the statistics. If, for example, it is set as 300 (5 minutes), all the statistics are cleared for every 5 minutes. By default it is 0, meaning that statistics are not reset.

===== OperationHeartbeats

It shows the deviation between member/member operation heartbeats. Every member will send to every other member, regardless if
there is an operation running on behalf of that member, an operation heartbeat. It contains a listing of all `callId`s of the running
operations from a given member. This plugin also works fine between members/lite-members.

Because this operation heartbeat is sent periodically; by default 1/4 of the operation call timeout of 60 seconds, we would expect
an operation heartbeat to be received every 15 seconds. Operation heartbeats are high priority packets (so they overtake regular packets)
and are processed by an isolated thread in the invocation monitor. If there is any deviation in the frequency of receiving
these packets, it may be due to the problems such as network latencies.

The following shows an example of the output where an operation heartbeat has not been received for 37 seconds:

```
20-7-2017 11:12:55 OperationHeartbeats[
            member[10.212.1.119]:5701[
                   deviation(%)=146.6666717529297
                   noHeartbeat(ms)=37,000
                   lastHeartbeat(ms)=1,500,538,375,603
                   lastHeartbeat(date-time)=20-7-2017 11:12:55
                   now(ms)=1,500,538,338,603
                   now(date-time)=20-7-2017 11:12:18]]]
```

The OperationHeartbeats plugin is enabled by default since it has very little overhead and will only print to the diagnostics
file if the max-deviation (explained below) is exceeded.

You can control the OperationHeartbeats plugin using the following properties:

- `hazelcast.diagnostics.operation-heartbeat.seconds`: The frequency this plugin is writing the collected information to the disk. It is configured to be 10 seconds by default. 0 disables the plugin.
- `hazelcast.diagnostics.operation-heartbeat.max-deviation-percentage`:  The maximum allowed deviation percentage. Its default value is 33. For example, with a default 60 call timeout and operation heartbeat interval being 15 seconds, the maximum deviation with a deviation-percentage of 33, is 5 seconds. So there is no problem if a packet is arrived after 19 seconds, but if it arrives after 21 seconds, then the plugin will render.

===== MemberHeartbeats

This plugin looks a lot like the OperationHeartbeats plugin, but instead of relying on operation heartbeats to determine the deviation, it relies on member/member cluster heartbeats. Every member will send a heartbeat to every other member periodically (by default every 5 seconds).

Just like the OperationHeartbeats, the MemberHeartbeats plugin can be used to detect if there are networking problems long before they actually lead to problems such as split-brain syndromes.

The following shows an example of the output where no member/member heartbeat has been received for 9 seconds:

```
20-7-2017 19:32:22 MemberHeartbeats[
             member[10.212.1.119]:5701[
                    deviation(%)=80.0
                    noHeartbeat(ms)=9,000
                    lastHeartbeat(ms)=1,500,568,333,645
                    lastHeartbeat(date-time)=20-7-2017 19:32:13
                    now(ms)=1,500,568,342,645
                    now(date-time)=20-7-2017 19:32:22]]
```

The MemberHeartbeats plugin is enabled by default since it has very little overhead and will only print to the diagnostics
file if the max-deviation (explained below) is exceeded.

You can control the MemberHeartbeats plugin using the following properties:

- `hazelcast.diagnostics.member-heartbeat.seconds`: The frequency this plugin is writing the collected information to the disk. It is configured to be 10 seconds by default. 0 disables the plugin.
- `hazelcast.diagnostics.member-heartbeat.max-deviation-percentage`: The maximum allowed deviation percentage. Its default value is 100. For example, if the interval of member/member heartbeats is 5 seconds, a 100% deviation will be fine with heartbeats arriving up to 5 seconds after they are expected. So a heartbeat arriving after 9 seconds will not be rendered, but a heartbeat received after 11 seconds will be rendered.


===== OperationThreadSamples

This plugin samples the operation threads and checks the running operations/tasks. Hazelcast has the <<slowoperationdetector, slow operation detector>> which is useful for very slow operations. But it may not be efficient for high volumes of not too slow operations. Using the OperationThreadSamples plugin it is more clear to see which operations are actually running.

You can control the OperationThreadSamples plugin using the following properties:

* `hazelcast.diagnostics.operationthreadsamples.period.seconds`: The frequency this plugin is writing the collected information to the disk. An efficient value for production would be 30, 60 or more seconds. 0, which is the default value, disables the plugin.
* `hazelcast.diagnostics.operationthreadsamples.sampler.period.millis`: The period in milliseconds between taking samples. The lower the value, the higher the overhead but also the higher the precision. Its default value is 100 ms.
* `hazelcast.diagnostics.operationthreadsamples.includeName`: Specifies whether the data structures' name pointed to by the operation (if available) should be included in the name of the samples. Its default value is false.

The following shows an example of the output when the property `hazelcast.diagnostics.operationthreadsamples.includeName` is false:

```
28-08-2018 07:40:07 1535442007330 OperationThreadSamples[

                        com.hazelcast.client.impl.operations.ClientReAuthOperation=33 0.51099414%]]
```

As can be seen above, the `MapSizeOperations` run on the operation threads most of the time.


===== WanDiagnostics

The WAN diagnostics plugin provides information about the WAN replication.

It is disabled by default and can be configured using the following property:

* `hazelcast.diagnostics.wan.period.seconds`: The frequency this plugin is writing the collected information to the disk. 0 disables the plugin.

The following shows an example of the output:

```

```

=== Health Check and Monitoring

Hazelcast provides the HTTP-based Health Check endpoint, Health Check script and Health Monitoring utility.


==== Health Check

This is Hazelcast's HTTP based health check implementation which provides basic information about your cluster and member (on which it is launched).

First, you need to enable the health check. To do this, set the `hazelcast.http.healthcheck.enabled` system property to `true`. By default, it is `false`.

Now you retrieve information about your cluster's health status (member state, cluster state, cluster size, etc.) by launching `http://<your member's host IP>:5701/hazelcast/health` on your preferred browser.

An example output is given below:

```
Hazelcast::NodeState=ACTIVE
Hazelcast::ClusterState=ACTIVE
Hazelcast::ClusterSafe=TRUE
Hazelcast::MigrationQueueSize=0
Hazelcast::ClusterSize=2
```

Please refer to the <<managing-cluster-and-member-states, Managing Cluster and Member States section>> to learn more about each state of a Hazelcast cluster and member.


==== Health Check Script

The `healthcheck.sh` script comes with the Hazelcast package. Internally, it uses the HTTP-based Health Check endpoint and that is why you also need to set the `hazelcast.http.healthcheck.enabled` system property to `true`.

You can use the script to check health parameters in the following manner:

```
$ ./healthcheck.sh <parameters>
```

The following parameters can be used:

* `-o`, `--operation`: Health check operation. It can be `all`, `node-state`, `cluster-state`, `cluster-safe`, `migration-queue-size` and `cluster-size`.
* `-a`, `--address`: Defines which IP address Hazelcast member is running on. Its default value is `127.0.0.1`.
* `-p`, `--port`: Defines which port Hazelcast member is running on. Its default value is `5701`.
* `-h`, `--help`: Lists the parameter descriptions along with a usage example.


*_Example 1: Checking Member State of a Healthy Cluster:_*

Assuming the member is deployed under the address `127.0.0.1:5701` and it is in the healthy state, the following output is expected:


```
$ ./healthcheck.sh -a 127.0.0.1 -p 5701 -o node-state
ACTIVE
```

*_Example 2: Checking Safety of a Non-Existing Cluster:_*

Assuming there is no member running under the address `127.0.0.1:5701`, the following output is expected:

```
$ ./healthcheck.sh -a 127.0.0.1 -p 5701 -o cluster-safe
Error while checking health of hazelcast cluster on ip 127.0.0.1 on port 5701.
Please check that cluster is running and that health check is enabled (property set to true: 'hazelcast.http.healthcheck.enabled' or 'hazelcast.rest.enabled').
```



==== Health Monitor

Health monitor periodically prints logs in your console to provide information about your member's state. By default, it is enabled when you start your cluster.

You can set the interval of health monitoring using the `hazelcast.health.monitoring.delay.seconds` system property. Its default value is 30 seconds.

The system property `hazelcast.health.monitoring.level` is used to configure the monitoring's log level. If it is set to OFF, the monitoring will be disabled. If it is set to NOISY, monitoring logs are always printed for the defined intervals. When it is SILENT, which is the default value, monitoring logs are printed only when the values exceed some predefined thresholds. These thresholds are related to memory and CPU percentages, and can be configured using the `hazelcast.health.monitoring.threshold.memory.percentage` and `hazelcast.health.monitoring.threshold.cpu.percentage` system properties, whose default values are both 70.

The following is an example monitoring output

```

==== Using Health Check on F5 BIG-IP LTM

The F5® BIG-IP® Local Traffic Manager™ (LTM) can be used as a load balancer for Hazelcast cluster members. This section describes how you can configure a health monitor to check the Hazelcast member states.

===== Monitor Types

Following types of monitors can be used to track Hazelcast cluster members:

- HTTP Monitor: A custom HTTP monitor enables you to send a command to Hazelcast’s Health Check API using HTTP requests. This is a good choice if SSL/TLS is not enabled in your cluster.
- HTTPS Monitor: A custom HTTPS monitor enables you to verify the health of Hazelcast cluster members by sending a command to Hazelcast’s Health Check API using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security. This is a good choice if SSL/TLS is enabled in your cluster.
- TCP\_HALF\_OPEN Monitor: A TCP\_HALF\_OPEN monitor is a very basic monitor that only checks that the TCP port used by Hazelcast is open and responding to connection requests. It does not interact with the Hazelcast Health Check API. The TCP\_HALF\_OPEN monitor can be used with or without SSL/TLS.


===== Configuration

After signing in to the BIG-IP LTM User Interface, follow F5’s https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ltm-monitors-reference-11-6-0/3.html#unique_859105660[instructions] to create a new monitor. Next, apply the following configuration according to your monitor type.

====== HTTP/HTTPS Monitors

NOTE: Please note that you should enable the Hazelcast health check for HTTP/HTTPS monitors to run. To do this, set the `hazelcast.http.healthcheck.enabled` system property to true. By default, it is false.

**Using a GET request:**

* Set the “Send String” as follows:
+
```
GET /hazelcast/health HTTP/1.1\r\n\nHost: [HOST-ADDRESS-OF-HAZELCAST-MEMBER] \r\nConnection: Close\r\n\r\n
```
+
* Set the “Receive String” as follows:
+
```
Hazelcast::NodeState=ACTIVE\nHazelcast::ClusterState=ACTIVE\nHazelcast::ClusterSafe=TRUE\nHazelcast::MigrationQueueSize=0\nHazelcast::ClusterSize=([^\s]+)\n
```


The BIG-IP LTM monitors accept regular expressions in these strings allowing you to configure them as needed. The example provided above will remain green even if the cluster size changes.


**Using a HEAD request:**

* Set the “Send String” as follows:
+
```
HEAD /hazelcast/health HTTP/1.1\r\n\nHost: [HOST-ADDRESS-OF-HAZELCAST-MEMBER] \r\nConnection: Close\r\n\r\n
```
+
* Set the “Receive String” as follows:
+
```
200 OK
```


As you can see, the HEAD request only checks for a `200 OK` response. A Hazelcast cluster member will send this status code when it is alive and running without issue. This provides a very basic health check. For increased flexibility, we recommend using the GET request API.


====== TCP_HALF_OPEN Monitors

- Set the "Type" as `TCP Half Open`.
- Optionally, set the "Alias Service Port" as the port of Hazelcast cluster member if you want to specify the port in the monitor.


=== Management Center

Hazelcast Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your cluster members running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring the overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze and browse your data structures in detail, update map configurations and take thread dumps from members. You can run scripts (JavaScript, Groovy, etc.) and commands on your members with its scripting and console modules.

Please refer to http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html[Hazelcast Management Center Documentation] for its usage details.
