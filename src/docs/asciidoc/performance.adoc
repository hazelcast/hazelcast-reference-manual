== Performance

This chapter provides information on the performance features of Hazelcast including near cache, slow operations detector, back pressure and data affinity. Moreover, the chapter describes the best performance practices for Hazelcast deployed on Amazon EC2. It also describes the threading models for I/O, events, executors and operations. 

=== Data Affinity

Data affinity ensures that related entries exist on the same member. If related data is on the same member, operations can be executed without the cost of extra network calls and extra wire data. This feature is provided by using the same partition keys for related data.

==== PartitionAware

**Co-location of related data and computation**

Hazelcast has a standard way of finding out which member owns/manages each key object. The following operations will be routed to the same member, since all of them are operating based on the same key `"key1"`.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Map mapA = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "mapA" );
Map mapB = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "mapB" );
Map mapC = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "mapC" );

// since map names are different, operation will be manipulating
// different entries, but the operation will take place on the
// same member since the keys ("key1") are the same
mapA.put( "key1", value );
mapB.get( "key1" );
mapC.remove( "key1" );

// lock operation will still execute on the same member
// of the cluster since the key ("key1") is same
hazelcastInstance.getLock( "key1" ).lock();

// distributed execution will execute the 'runnable' on the
// same member since "key1" is passed as the key.   
hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService().executeOnKeyOwner( runnable, "key1" );
----

When the keys are the same, entries are stored on the same member. But we sometimes want to have related entries stored on the same member, such as a customer and his/her order entries. We would have a customers map with customerId as the key and an orders map with orderId as the key. Since customerId and orderId are different keys, a customer and his/her orders may fall into different members in your cluster. So how can we have them stored on the same member? We create an affinity between customer and orders. If we make them part of the same partition then these entries will be co-located. We achieve this by making orderIds `PartitionAware`.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/performance/OrderKey.java[tag=orderkey]
----


Notice that OrderKey implements `PartitionAware` and that `getPartitionKey()` returns the `customerId`. This will make sure that the `Customer` entry and its `Order`s will be stored on the same member.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Map mapCustomers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "customers" );
Map mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "orders" );

// create the customer entry with customer id = 1
mapCustomers.put( 1, customer );

// now create the orders for this customer
mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 21, 1 ), order );
mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 22, 1 ), order );
mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 23, 1 ), order );
----

Assume that you have a customers map where `customerId` is the key and the customer object is the value. You want to remove one of the customer orders and return the number of remaining orders. Here is how you would normally do it.

[source,java]
----
public static int removeOrder( long customerId, long orderId ) throws Exception {
    IMap<Long, Customer> mapCustomers = instance.getMap( "customers" );
    IMap mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "orders" );

    mapCustomers.lock( customerId );
    mapOrders.remove( orderId );
    Set orders = orderMap.keySet(Predicates.equal( "customerId", customerId ));
    mapCustomers.unlock( customerId );

    return orders.size();
}
----

There are couple of things you should consider.

* There are four distributed operations there: lock, remove, keySet, unlock. Can you reduce 
the number of distributed operations?
* The customer object may not be that big, but can you not have to pass that object through the 
wire? Think about a scenario where you set order count to the customer object for fast access, so you 
should do a get and a put, and as a result, the customer object is passed through the wire twice.

Instead, why not move the computation over to the member (JVM) where your customer data resides. Here is how you can do this with distributed executor service.

. Send a `PartitionAware` `Callable` task.
. `Callable` does the deletion of the order right there and returns with the remaining 
order count.
. Upon completion of the `Callable` task, return the result (remaining order count). You 
do not have to wait until the task is completed; since distributed executions are asynchronous, you can do other things in the meantime.

Here is an example code.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

    public int removeOrder(long customerId, long orderId) throws Exception {
        IExecutorService executorService = hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService("ExecutorService");

        OrderDeletionTask task = new OrderDeletionTask(customerId, orderId);
        Future<Integer> future = executorService.submit(task);
        int remainingOrders = future.get();

        return remainingOrders;
    }

    public static class OrderDeletionTask
            implements Callable<Integer>, PartitionAware, Serializable, HazelcastInstanceAware {

        private long orderId;
        private long customerId;
        private HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;

        public OrderDeletionTask() {
        }

        public OrderDeletionTask(long customerId, long orderId) {
            this.customerId = customerId;
            this.orderId = orderId;
        }

        @Override
        public Integer call() {
            IMap<Long, Customer> customerMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap("customers");
            IMap<OrderKey, Order> orderMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap("orders");

            customerMap.lock(customerId);

            Predicate predicate = Predicates.equal("customerId", customerId);
            Set<OrderKey> orderKeys = orderMap.localKeySet(predicate);
            int orderCount = orderKeys.size();
            for (OrderKey key : orderKeys) {
                if (key.orderId == orderId) {
                    orderCount--;
                    orderMap.delete(key);
                }
            }

            customerMap.unlock(customerId);

            return orderCount;
        }

        @Override
        public Object getPartitionKey() {
            return customerId;
        }

        @Override
        public void setHazelcastInstance(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {
            this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance;
        }
    }
----

The benefits of doing the same operation with distributed `ExecutorService` based on the key are:

* Only one distributed execution (`executorService.submit(task)`), instead of four.
* Less data is sent over the wire.
* Since lock/update/unlock cycle is done locally (local to the customer data), lock duration for the `Customer` entry is much less, thus enabling higher concurrency.


==== PartitioningStrategy

Another way of storing the related data on the same location is using/implementing the class `PartitioningStrategy`. Normally (if no partitioning strategy is defined), Hazelcast finds the partition of a key first by converting the object to binary and then by hashing this binary. If a partitioning strategy is defined, Hazelcast injects the key to the strategy and the strategy returns an object out of which the partition is calculated by hashing it.

Hazelcast offers the following out-of-the-box partitioning strategies:

- `DefaultPartitioningStrategy`: Default strategy. It checks whether the key implements `PartitionAware`. If it implements, the object is converted to binary and then hashed, to find the partition of the key.
- `StringPartitioningStrategy`: Works only for string keys. It uses the string after `@` character as the partition ID. For example, if you have two keys `ordergroup1@region1` and `customergroup1@region1`, both `ordergroup1` and `customergroup1` will fall into the partition where `region1` is located.
- `StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy`: Works as the combination of the above two strategies. If the key implements `PartitionAware`, it works like the `DefaultPartitioningStrategy`. If it is a string key, it works like the `StringPartitioningStrategy`.

Following are the example configuration snippets. Note that these strategy configurations are **per map**.


**Declarative Configuration**


[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
...
   <map name="name-of-the-map">
   ...
      <partition-strategy>
         com.hazelcast.partition.strategy.StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy
      </partition-strategy>
   ...
   </map>
...
</hazelcast>
----

**Programmatic Configuration**

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig("name-of-the-map");
PartitioningStrategyConfig psConfig = mapConfig.getPartitioningStrategyConfig();
psConfig.setPartitioningStrategyClass( "StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy" );

// OR
psConfig.setPartitioningStrategy(YourCustomPartitioningStrategy);
...
----

You can also define your own partition strategy by implementing the class `PartitioningStrategy`. To enable your implementation, add the full class name to your Hazelcast configuration using either the declarative or programmatic approach, as sampled above.

As stated previously, above strategies are defined **per map** in your Hazelcast member. You can also define a strategy **per member** in your Hazelcast cluster. This can be done by defining the `hazelcast.partitioning.strategy.class` system property. An example declarative way of configuring this property is shown below:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
...
  <properties>
    <property name="hazelcast.partitioning.strategy.class">
       com.hazelcast.partition.strategy.StringAndPartitionAwarePartitioningStrategy
    </property>
    ....
  </properties>
  ...
</hazelcast>
----

You can also use other system property configuring options as explained in the <<configuring-with-system-properties, Configuring with System Properties section>>.


=== Running in EC2

For the best performance of your Hazelcast in AWS EC2: 

* It is best to select the newest Linux AMIs.
* HVM based instances give the best performance.
* Select at least a system with 8 vCPUs, e.g., c4.2xlarge. For an overview of all types of EC2 instances, please check https://www.ec2instances.info.
* Consider setting a placement group. A placement group can have a significant impact on the performance.



=== Back Pressure

Hazelcast uses operations to make remote calls. For example, a `map.get` is an operation and a `map.put` is one operation for the primary 
and one operation for each of the backups, i.e. `map.put` is executed for the primary and also for each backup. In most cases, there will be a natural balance between the number of threads performing operations
and the number of operations being executed. However, there are two situations where this balance and operations 
can pile up and eventually lead to Out of Memory Exception (OOME):

- Asynchronous calls: With async calls, the system may be flooded with the requests.
- Asynchronous backups: The asynchronous backups may be piling up.

To prevent the system from crashing, Hazelcast provides back pressure. Back pressure works by:
 
- limiting the number of concurrent operation invocations, 
- periodically making an async backup sync.

==== Member Side

Back pressure is disabled by default and you can enable it using the following system property:

`hazelcast.backpressure.enabled`

To control the number of concurrent invocations, you can configure the number of invocations allowed per partition using the 
following system property:

`hazelcast.backpressure.max.concurrent.invocations.per.partition`

The default value of this system property is 100. Using a default configuration a system is allowed to have (271 + 1) * 100 = 27200 concurrent invocations (271 partitions + 1 for generic operations).
 
Back pressure is only applied to normal operations. System operations like heart beats and partition migration operations 
are not influenced by back pressure. 27200 invocations might seem like a lot, but keep in mind that executing a task on `IExecutor` 
or acquiring a lock also requires an operation.

If the maximum number of invocations has been reached, Hazelcast will automatically apply an exponential back off policy. This
gives the system some time to deal with the load. Using the following system property, you can configure the maximum time to wait before a `HazelcastOverloadException` is thrown:

`hazelcast.backpressure.backoff.timeout.millis`

This system property's default value is 60000 milliseconds.

The Health Monitor keeps an eye on the usage of the invocations. If it sees a member has consumed 70% or more of the invocations, it starts to log health messages.

Apart from controlling the number of invocations, you also need to control the number of pending async backups. This is done
by periodically making these backups sync instead of async. This forces all pending backups to get drained. For this, Hazelcast tracks the number of asynchronous backups for each partition. At every **Nth** call, one synchronization is forced. This **N** is 
controlled through the following property:

`hazelcast.backpressure.syncwindow`

This system property's default value is 100. It means, out of 100 *asynchronous* backups, Hazelcast makes 1 of them a *synchronous* one. A randomization is added, so the sync window with default configuration will be between 75 and 125 
invocations. 

==== Client Side

To prevent the system at the client side from overloading, you can apply a constraint on the number of concurrent invocations. You can use the following system property at the client side for this purpose:

`hazelcast.client.max.concurrent.invocations`

This property defines the maximum allowed number of concurrent invocations. When it is not explicitly set, it has the value `Integer.MAX_VALUE` by default, which means infinite. When you set it and if the maximum number of concurrent invocations is exceeded this value, Hazelcast will throw `HazelcastOverloadException` when a new invocation comes in.

Please note that back off timeout and controlling the number of pending async backups (sync window) is not supported at the client side.


NOTE: Please refer to the <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>> to learn how to configure the system properties.

=== Threading Model

Your application server has its own threads. Hazelcast does not use these; it manages its own threads.

==== I/O Threading

Hazelcast uses a pool of threads for I/O. A single thread does not perform all the I/O. Instead, multiple threads perform the I/O. On each cluster member, the I/O threading is split up in 3 types of I/O threads:

* I/O thread for the accept requests.
* I/O threads to read data from other members/clients.
* I/O threads to write data to other members/clients.

You can configure the number of I/O threads using the `hazelcast.io.thread.count` system property. Its default value is 3 per member. If 3 is used, in total there are 7 I/O threads: 1 accept I/O thread, 3 read I/O threads and 3 write I/O threads. Each I/O thread has its own Selector instance and waits on the `Selector.select` if there is nothing to do.

NOTE: You can also specify counts for input and output threads separately. There are `hazelcast.io.input.thread.count` and `hazelcast.io.output.thread.count` properties for this purpose. Please refer to the <<system-properties, System Properties section>> for information on these properties and how to set them.


Hazelcast periodically scans utilization of each I/O thread and can decide to migrate a connection to a new thread if the existing thread is servicing a disproportionate number of I/O events. You can customize the scanning interval by configuring the `hazelcast.io.balancer.interval.seconds` system property; its default interval is 20 seconds. You can disable the balancing process by setting this property to a negative value.

In case of the read I/O thread, when sufficient bytes for a packet have been received, the `Packet` object is created. This `Packet` object is 
then sent to the system where it is de-multiplexed. If the `Packet` header signals that it is an operation/response, the `Packet` is handed 
over to the operation service (please see the <<operation-threading, Operation Threading section>>). If the `Packet` is an event, it is handed 
over to the event service (please see the <<event-threading, Event Threading section>>). 


==== Event Threading

Hazelcast uses a shared event system to deal with components that rely on events, such as topic, collections, listeners and Near Cache. 

Each cluster member has an array of event threads and each thread has its own work queue. When an event is produced,
either locally or remotely, an event thread is selected (depending on if there is a message ordering) and the event is placed
in the work queue for that event thread.

The following properties
can be set to alter the behavior of the system.

* `hazelcast.event.thread.count`: Number of event-threads in this array. Its default value is 5.
* `hazelcast.event.queue.capacity`: Capacity of the work queue. Its default value is 1000000.
* `hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis`: Timeout for placing an item on the work queue in milliseconds. Its default value is 250 milliseconds.

If you process a lot of events and have many cores, changing the value of `hazelcast.event.thread.count` property to
a higher value is a good practice. This way, more events can be processed in parallel.

Multiple components share the same event queues. If there are 2 topics, say A and B, for certain messages
they may share the same queue(s) and hence the same event thread. If there are a lot of pending messages produced by A, then B needs to wait.
Also, when processing a message from A takes a lot of time and the event thread is used for that, B suffers from this. 
That is why it is better to offload processing to a dedicated thread (pool) so that systems are better isolated.

If the events are produced at a higher rate than they are consumed, the queue grows in size. To prevent overloading the system
and running into an `OutOfMemoryException`, the queue is given a capacity of 1 million items. When the maximum capacity is reached, the items are
dropped. This means that the event system is a 'best effort' system. There is no guarantee that you are going to get an
event. Topic A might have a lot of pending messages and therefore B cannot receive messages because the queue
has no capacity and messages for B are dropped.


==== IExecutor Threading

Executor threading is straight forward. When a task is received to be executed on Executor E, then E will have its
own `ThreadPoolExecutor` instance and the work is placed in the work queue of this executor. Thus, Executors are fully isolated, but still share the same underlying hardware - most importantly the CPUs. 

You can configure the IExecutor using the `ExecutorConfig` (programmatic configuration) or using `<executor>` (declarative configuration). Please also see the <<configuring-executor-service, Configuring Executor Service section>>.

==== Operation Threading

There are 2 types of operations:

* Operations that are aware of a certain partition, e.g., `IMap.get(key)`.
* Operations that are not partition aware, such as the `IExecutorService.executeOnMember(command, member)` operation.

Each of these operation types has a different threading model explained in the following sections.

===== Partition-aware Operations

To execute partition-aware operations, an array of operation threads is created. The default value of this array's size is the number of cores and it has a minimum value of 2. This value can be changed using the `hazelcast.operation.thread.count` property.

Each operation thread has its own work queue and it consumes messages from this work queue. If a partition-aware 
operation needs to be scheduled, the right thread is found using the formula below.

`threadIndex = partitionId % partition thread-count`

After the `threadIndex` is determined, the operation is put in the work queue of that operation thread. This means the followings:

* A single operation thread executes operations for multiple partitions; if there are 271 partitions and 10 partition threads, then roughly every operation thread executes operations for 27 partitions.
* Each partition belongs to only 1 operation thread. All operations for a partition are always handled by exactly the same operation thread. 
* Concurrency control is not needed to deal with partition-aware operations because once a partition-aware operation is put in the work queue of a partition-aware operation thread, only 1 thread is able to touch that partition.

Because of this threading strategy, there are two forms of false sharing you need to be aware of:

* False sharing of the partition - two completely independent data structures share the same partition. For example, if there is a map `employees` and a map `orders`, the method `employees.get("peter")` running on partition 25 may be blocked by the method `orders.get(1234)` also running on partition 25. If independent data structures share the same partition, a slow operation on one data structure can slow down the other data structures.
* False sharing of the partition-aware operation thread - each operation thread is responsible for executing
 operations on a number of partitions. For example, *thread 1* could be responsible for partitions 0, 10, 20, etc. and *thread-2* could be responsible for partitions
 1, 11, 21, etc. If an operation for partition 1 takes a lot of time, it blocks the execution of an operation for partition
 11 because both of them are mapped to the same operation thread.

You need to be careful with long running operations because you could starve operations of a thread. 
As a general rule, the partition thread should be released as soon as possible because operations are not designed
as long running operations. That is why, for example, it is very dangerous to execute a long running operation 
using `AtomicReference.alter()` or an `IMap.executeOnKey()`, because these operations block other operations to be executed.

Currently, there is no support for work stealing. Different partitions that map to the same thread may need to wait 
till one of the partitions is finished, even though there are other free partition-aware operation threads available.

**Example:**

Take a cluster with three members. Two members will have 90 primary partitions and one member will have 91 primary partitions. Let's
say you have one CPU and four cores per CPU. By default, four operation threads will be allocated to serve 90 or 91 partitions.

===== Non-Partition-aware Operations

To execute operations that are not partition-aware, e.g., `IExecutorService.executeOnMember(command, member)`, generic operation 
threads are used. When the Hazelcast instance is started, an array of operation threads is created. The size of this array 
has a default value of the number of cores divided by two with a minimum value of 2. It can be changed using the 
`hazelcast.operation.generic.thread.count` property. 

A non-partition-aware operation thread does not execute an operation for a specific partition. Only partition-aware
  operation threads execute partition-aware operations. 

Unlike the partition-aware operation threads, all the generic operation threads share the same work queue: `genericWorkQueue`.

If a non-partition-aware operation needs to be executed, it is placed in that work queue and any generic operation 
thread can execute it. The big advantage is that you automatically have work balancing since any generic operation 
thread is allowed to pick up work from this queue.

The disadvantage is that this shared queue can be a point of contention. You may not see this contention in 
production since performance is dominated by I/O and the system does not run many non-partition-aware operations.
 
===== Priority Operations
 
In some cases, the system needs to run operations with a higher priority, e.g., an important system operation. To support priority operations, Hazelcast has the following features:

* For partition-aware operations: Each partition thread has its own work queue and it also has a priority
  work queue. The partition thread always checks the priority queue before it processes work from its normal work queue.
* For non-partition-aware operations: Next to the `genericWorkQueue`, there is also a `genericPriorityWorkQueue`. When a priority operation
 needs to be run, it is put in the `genericPriorityWorkQueue`. Like the partition-aware operation threads, a generic
 operation thread first checks the `genericPriorityWorkQueue` for work. 
 
Since a worker thread blocks on the normal work queue (either partition specific or generic), a priority operation
may not be picked up because it is not put in the queue where it is blocking. Hazelcast always sends a 'kick the worker' operation that  
only triggers the worker to wake up and check the priority queue. 

===== Operation-response and Invocation-future

When an Operation is invoked, a `Future` is returned. Please see the example code below.

[source,java]
----
GetOperation operation = new GetOperation( mapName, key );
Future future = operationService.invoke( operation );
future.get();
----

The calling side blocks for a reply. In this case, `GetOperation` is set in the work queue for the partition of `key`, where
it eventually is executed. Upon execution, a response is returned and placed on the `genericWorkQueue` where it is executed by a 
"generic operation thread". This thread signals the `future` and notifies the blocked thread that a response is available. 
Hazelcast has a plan of exposing this `future` to the outside world, and we will provide the ability to register a completion listener so you can perform asynchronous calls. 

===== Local Calls

When a local partition-aware call is done, an operation is made and handed over to the work queue of the correct partition operation thread,
and a `future` is returned. When the calling thread calls `get` on that `future`, it acquires a lock and waits for the result 
to become available. When a response is calculated, the `future` is looked up and the waiting thread is notified.  

In the future, this will be optimized to reduce the amount of expensive systems calls, such as `lock.acquire()`/`notify()` and the expensive
interaction with the operation-queue. Probably, we will add support for a caller-runs mode, so that an operation is directly run on
the calling thread.


=== SlowOperationDetector

The `SlowOperationDetector` monitors the operation threads and collects information about all slow operations. An `Operation` is a task executed by a generic or partition thread (see <<operation-threading, Operation Threading>>). An operation is considered as slow when it takes more computation time than the configured threshold.

The `SlowOperationDetector` stores the fully qualified classname of the operation and its stacktrace as well as operation details, start time and duration of each slow invocation. All collected data is available in the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#monitoring-members[Management Center].

The `SlowOperationDetector` is configured via the following system properties.

- `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.enabled`
- `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.log.purge.interval.seconds`
- `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.log.retention.seconds`
- `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.stacktrace.logging.enabled`
- `hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.threshold.millis`

Please refer to the <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>> for explanations of these properties.

==== Logging of Slow Operations

The detected slow operations are logged as warnings in the Hazelcast log files:

```
WARN 2015-05-07 11:05:30,890 SlowOperationDetector: [127.0.0.1]:5701
  Slow operation detected: com.hazelcast.map.impl.operation.PutOperation
  Hint: You can enable the logging of stacktraces with the following config
  property: hazelcast.slow.operation.detector.stacktrace.logging.enabled
WARN 2015-05-07 11:05:30,891 SlowOperationDetector: [127.0.0.1]:5701
  Slow operation detected: com.hazelcast.map.impl.operation.PutOperation
  (2 invocations)
WARN 2015-05-07 11:05:30,892 SlowOperationDetector: [127.0.0.1]:5701
  Slow operation detected: com.hazelcast.map.impl.operation.PutOperation
  (3 invocations)
```

Stacktraces are always reported to the Management Center, but by default they are not printed to keep the log size small. If logging of stacktraces is enabled, the full stacktrace is printed every 100 invocations. All other invocations print a shortened version.

==== Purging of Slow Operation Logs

Since a Hazelcast cluster can run for a very long time, Hazelcast purges the slow operation logs periodically to prevent an OOME. You can configure the purge interval and the retention time for each invocation.

The purging removes each invocation whose retention time is exceeded. When all invocations are purged from a slow operation log, the log is deleted.


=== Near Cache

Map or Cache entries in Hazelcast are partitioned across the cluster members. Hazelcast clients do not have local data at all. Suppose you read the key `k` a number of times from a Hazelcast client or `k` is owned by another member in your cluster. Then each `map.get(k)` or `cache.get(k)` will be a remote operation, which creates a lot of network trips. If you have a data structure that is mostly read, then you should consider creating a local Near Cache, so that reads are sped up and less network traffic is created. 

These benefits do not come for free, please consider the following trade-offs:

- Members with a Near Cache will have to hold the extra cached data, which increases memory consumption.
- If invalidation is enabled and entries are updated frequently, then invalidations will be costly.
- Near Cache breaks the strong consistency guarantees; you might be reading stale data.

Near Cache is highly recommended for data structures that are mostly read.

In a client/server system you must enable the Near Cache separately on the client, without the need to configure it on the server. Please note that Near Cache configuration is specific to the server or client itself: a data structure on a server may not have Near Cache configured while the same data structure on a client may have Near Cache configured. They also can have different Near Cache configurations.

If you are using Near Cache, you should take into account that your hits to the keys in the Near Cache are not reflected as hits to the original keys on the primary members. This has for example an impact on IMap's maximum idle seconds or time-to-live seconds expiration. Therefore, even though there is a hit on a key in Near Cache, your original key on the primary member may expire.

NOTE: Near Cache works only when you access data via `map.get(k)` or `cache.get(k)` methods. Data returned using a predicate is not stored in the Near Cache.

==== Hazelcast Data Structures with Near Cache Support

The following matrix shows the Hazelcast data structures with Near Cache support. Please have a look at the next section for a detailed explanation of `cache-local-entries`, `local-update-policy`, `preloader` and `serialize-keys`.

NOTE: Even though lite members do not store any data for Hazelcast data structures, you can enable Near Cache on lite members for faster reads.

==== Configuring Near Cache

The following shows the configuration for the Hazelcast Near Cache.

NOTE: Please keep in mind that, if you want to use near cache on a Hazelcast member, configure it on the member; if you want to use it on a Hazelcast client, configure it on the client.


**Declarative**:

[source,xml]

             store-interval-seconds="(0..INT_MAX)"/>
</near-cache>
----

The element `<near-cache>` has an optional attribute `name` whose default value is `default`.

**Programmatic**:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/performance/NearCacheConfigurationSample.java[tag=nearcacheconfig]
----

The class https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/NearCacheConfig.html[NearCacheConfig] is used for all supported Hazelcast data structures on members and clients.

Following are the descriptions of all configuration elements:

* `in-memory-format`: Specifies in which format data will be stored in your Near Cache. Note that a map's in-memory format can be different from that of its Near Cache. Available values are as follows:
** `BINARY`: Data will be stored in serialized binary format (default value).
** `OBJECT`: Data will be stored in deserialized form.
** `NATIVE`: Data will be stored in the Near Cache that uses Hazelcast's High-Density Memory Store feature. This option is available only in Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD. Note that a map and its Near Cache can independently use High-Density Memory Store. For example, while your map does not use High-Density Memory Store, its Near Cache can use it.
* `serialize-keys`: Specifies if the keys of a Near Cache entry should be serialized or not. Serializing the keys has a big impact on the read performance of the Near Cache. It should just be activated when you have mutable keys, which are changed after use for the Near Cache. Its default value is `false`.
* `invalidate-on-change`: Specifies whether the cached entries are evicted when the entries are updated or removed. Its default value is true.
* `time-to-live-seconds`: Maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the Near Cache. Entries that are older than this period are automatically evicted from the Near Cache. Regardless of the eviction policy used, `time-to-live-seconds` still applies. Any integer between 0 and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. 0 means infinite. Its default value is 0.
* `max-idle-seconds`: Maximum number of seconds each entry can stay in the Near Cache as untouched (not read). Entries that are not read more than this period are removed from the Near Cache. Any integer between 0 and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. 0 means `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Its default value is 0.
* `eviction`: Specifies the eviction behavior when you use High-Density Memory Store for your Near Cache. It has the following attributes:
** `eviction-policy`: Eviction policy configuration. Available values are as follows:
*** `LRU`: Least Recently Used (default value).
*** `LFU`: Least Frequently Used.
*** `NONE`: No items will be evicted and the property max-size will be ignored. You still can combine it with `time-to-live-seconds` and `max-idle-seconds` to evict items from the Near Cache.
***- `RANDOM`: A random item will be evicted.
** `max-size-policy`: Maximum size policy for eviction of the Near Cache. Available values are as follows:
*** `ENTRY_COUNT`: Maximum size based on the entry count in the Near Cache (default value).
*** `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: Maximum used native memory size of the specified Near Cache in MB to trigger the eviction. If the used native memory size exceeds this threshold, the eviction is triggered.  Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise.
*** `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: Maximum used native memory percentage of the specified Near Cache to trigger the eviction. If the native memory usage percentage (relative to maximum native memory size) exceeds this threshold, the eviction is triggered. Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise.
*** `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: Minimum free native memory size of the specified Near Cache in MB to trigger the eviction. If free native memory size goes below this threshold, eviction is triggered. Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise.
*** `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: Minimum free native memory percentage of the specified Near Cache to trigger eviction. If free native memory percentage (relative to maximum native memory size) goes below this threshold, eviction is triggered. Available only for `NATIVE` in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise.
** `size`: Maximum size of the Near Cache used for `max-size-policy`. When this is reached the Near Cache is evicted based on the policy defined. Any integer between `1` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This value has different defaults, depending on the data structure.
*** `IMap`: Its default value is `Integer.MAX_VALUE` for on-heap maps and `10000` for the `NATIVE` in-memory format.
*** `JCache`: Its default value is `10000`.
* `cache-local-entries`: Specifies whether the local entries will be cached. It can be useful when in-memory format for Near Cache is different from that of the map. By default, it is disabled. Is just available on Hazelcast members, not on Hazelcast clients (which have no local entries).
* `local-update-policy`: Specifies the update policy of the local Near Cache. It is available on JCache clients. Available values are as follows:
** `INVALIDATE`: Removes the Near Cache entry on mutation. After the mutative call to the member completes but before the operation returns to the caller, the Near Cache entry is removed. Until the mutative operation completes, the readers still continue to read the old value. But as soon as the update completes the Near Cache entry is removed. Any threads reading the key after this point will have a Near Cache miss and call through to the member, obtaining the new entry. This setting provides read-your-writes consistency. This is the default setting.
** `CACHE_ON_UPDATE`: Updates the Near Cache entry on mutation. After the mutative call to the member completes but before the put returns to the caller, the Near Cache entry is updated. So a remove will remove it and one of the put methods will update it to the new value. Until the update/remove operation completes, the entry's old value can still be read from the Near Cache. But before the call completes the Near Cache entry is updated. Any threads reading the key after this point will read the new entry. If the mutative operation was a remove, the key will no longer exist in the cache, both the Near Cache and the original copy in the member. The member will initiate an invalidate event to any other Near Caches, however the caller Near Cache is not invalidated as it already has the new value. This setting also provides read-your-writes consistency.
* `preloader`: Specifies if the Near Cache should store and pre-load its keys for a faster re-population after a Hazelcast client restart. Is just available on IMap and JCache clients. It has the following attributes:
** `enabled`: Specifies whether the preloader for this Near Cache is enabled or not, `true` or `false`.
** `directory`: Specifies the parent directory for the preloader of this Near Cache. The filenames for the preloader storage will be generated from the Near Cache name. You can additionally specify the parent directory to have multiple clients on the same machine with the same Near Cache names.
** `store-initial-delay-seconds`: Specifies the delay in seconds until the keys of this Near Cache are stored for the first time. Its default value is `600` seconds.
** `store-interval-seconds`: Specifies the interval in seconds in which the keys of this Near Cache are stored. Its default value is `600` seconds. 

==== Near Cache Configuration Examples

This section shows some configuration examples for different Hazelcast data structures.

===== Near Cache Example for IMap

The following are configuration examples for IMap Near Caches for Hazelcast members and clients.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <map name="mostlyReadMap">
    <in-memory-format>BINARY</in-memory-format>
    <near-cache>
      <in-memory-format>OBJECT</in-memory-format>
      <invalidate-on-change>false</invalidate-on-change>
      <time-to-live-seconds>600</time-to-live-seconds>
      <eviction eviction-policy="NONE" max-size-policy="ENTRY_COUNT" size="5000"/>
      <cache-local-entries>true</cache-local-entries>
    </near-cache>
  </map>
</hazelcast>
----

[source,java]
----
EvictionConfig evictionConfig = new EvictionConfig()
  .setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy.NONE)
  .setMaximumSizePolicy(MaxSizePolicy.ENTRY_COUNT)
  .setSize(5000);

NearCacheConfig nearCacheConfig = new NearCacheConfig()
  .setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.OBJECT)
  .setInvalidateOnChange(false)
  .setTimeToLiveSeconds(600)
  .setEvictionConfig(evictionConfig);

Config config = new Config();
config.getMapConfig("mostlyReadMap")
  .setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.BINARY)
  .setNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig);
----

The Near Cache configuration for maps on members is a child of the map configuration, so you do not have to define the map name in the Near Cache configuration.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
  <near-cache name="mostlyReadMap">
    <in-memory-format>OBJECT</in-memory-format>
    <invalidate-on-change>true</invalidate-on-change>
    <eviction eviction-policy="LRU" max-size-policy="ENTRY_COUNT" size="50000"/>
  </near-cache>
</hazelcast-client>
----

[source,java]
----
EvictionConfig evictionConfig = new EvictionConfig()
  .setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy.LRU)
  .setMaximumSizePolicy(MaxSizePolicy.ENTRY_COUNT)
  .setSize(50000);

NearCacheConfig nearCacheConfig = new NearCacheConfig()
  .setName("mostlyReadMap")
  .setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.OBJECT)
  .setInvalidateOnChange(true)
  .setEvictionConfig(evictionConfig);

ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig()
  .addNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig);
----

The Near Cache on the client side must have the same name as the data structure on the member for which this Near Cache is being created. You can use wildcards, so in this example `mostlyRead*` would also match the map `mostlyReadMap`.

A Near Cache can have its own `in-memory-format` which is independent of the `in-memory-format` of the data structure.

===== Near Cache Example for JCache Clients

The following is a configuration example for a JCache Near Cache for a Hazelcast client.
 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
  <near-cache name="mostlyReadCache">
    <in-memory-format>OBJECT</in-memory-format>
    <invalidate-on-change>true</invalidate-on-change>
    <eviction eviction-policy="LRU" max-size-policy="ENTRY_COUNT" size="30000"/>
    <local-update-policy>CACHE_ON_UPDATE</local-update-policy>
  </near-cache>
</hazelcast-client>
----

[source,java]
----
EvictionConfig evictionConfig = new EvictionConfig()
  .setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy.LRU)
  .setMaximumSizePolicy(MaxSizePolicy.ENTRY_COUNT)
  .setSize(30000);

NearCacheConfig nearCacheConfig = new NearCacheConfig()
  .setName("mostlyReadCache")
  .setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.OBJECT)
  .setInvalidateOnChange(true)
  .setEvictionConfig(evictionConfig)
  .setLocalUpdatePolicy(LocalUpdatePolicy.CACHE_ON_UPDATE);

ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig()
  .addNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig);
----

===== Example for Near Cache with High-Density Memory Store

[navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD Feature*


The following is a configuration example for an IMap High-Density Near Cache for a Hazelcast member.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
  <map name="mostlyReadMapWithHighDensityNearCache">
    <in-memory-format>OBJECT</in-memory-format>
    <near-cache>
      <in-memory-format>NATIVE</in-memory-format>
      <eviction eviction-policy="LFU" max-size-policy="USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE" size="90"/>
    </near-cache>
  </map>
</hazelcast>
----

[source,java]
----
EvictionConfig evictionConfig = new EvictionConfig()
  .setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy.LFU)
  .setMaximumSizePolicy(MaxSizePolicy.USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE)
  .setSize(90);

NearCacheConfig nearCacheConfig = new NearCacheConfig()
  .setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.NATIVE)
  .setEvictionConfig(evictionConfig);

Config config = new Config();
config.getMapConfig("mostlyReadMapWithHighDensityNearCache")
  .setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.OBJECT)
  .setNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig);
----

Keep in mind that you should have already enabled the High-Density Memory Store usage for your cluster. Please see the <<configuring-high-density-memory-store, Configuring High-Density Memory Store section>>.

Note that a map and its Near Cache can independently use High-Density Memory Store. For example, if your map does not use High-Density Memory Store, its Near Cache can still use it.

==== Near Cache Eviction

In the scope of Near Cache, eviction means evicting (clearing) the entries selected according to the given `eviction-policy` when the specified `max-size-policy` has been reached.

The `max-size-policy` defines the state when the Near Cache is full and determines whether the eviction should be triggered. The `size` is either interpreted as entry count, memory size or percentage, depending on the chosen policy.

Once the eviction is triggered the configured `eviction-policy` determines which, if any, entries must be evicted.

==== Near Cache Expiration

Expiration means the eviction of expired records. A record is expired: 

- if it is not touched (accessed/read) for `max-idle-seconds`
- `time-to-live-seconds` passed since it is put to Near Cache

The actual expiration is performed in two cases:

- When a record is accessed: it is checked if the record is expired or not. If it is expired, it is evicted and `null` is returned as the value to the caller.
- In the background: there is an expiration task that periodically (currently 5 seconds) scans records and evicts the expired records.

==== Near Cache Invalidation

Invalidation is the process of removing an entry from the Near Cache when its value is updated or it is removed from the original data structure (to prevent stale reads). Near Cache invalidation happens asynchronously at the cluster level, but synchronously at the current member. This means that the Near Cache is invalidated within the whole cluster after the modifying operation is finished, but updated from the current member before the modifying operation is done. A modifying operation can be an EntryProcessor, an explicit update or remove as well as an expiration or eviction. Generally, whenever the state of an entry changes in the record store by updating its value or removing it, the invalidation event is sent for that entry.

Invalidations can be sent from members to client Near Caches or to member Near Caches, either individually or in batches. Default behavior is sending in batches. If there are lots of mutating operations such as put/remove on data structures, it is advised that you configure batch invalidations. This reduces the network traffic and keeps the eventing system less busy, but may increase the delay of individual invalidations.

You can use the following system properties to configure the Near Cache invalidation:

- `hazelcast.map.invalidation.batch.enabled`: Enable or disable batching. Its default value is `true`. When it is set to `false`, all invalidations are sent immediately.
- `hazelcast.map.invalidation.batch.size`: Maximum number of invalidations in a batch. Its default value is `100`.
- `hazelcast.map.invalidation.batchfrequency.seconds`: If the collected invalidations do not reach the configured batch size, a background process sends them periodically. Its default value is `10` seconds.

If there are a lot of clients or many mutating operations, batching should remain enabled and the batch size should be configured with the `hazelcast.map.invalidation.batch.size` system property to a suitable value.

==== Near Cache Consistency

===== Eventual Consistency

Near Caches are invalidated by invalidation events. Invalidation events can be lost due to the fire-and-forget fashion of eventing system. If an event is lost, reads from Near Cache can indefinitely be stale.

To solve this problem, starting with Hazelcast 3.8, Hazelcast provides eventually consistent behavior for IMap/JCache Near Caches by detecting invalidation losses.
After detection of an invalidation loss, stale data will be made unreachable and Near Cache's `get` calls to that data will be directed to underlying IMap/JCache to fetch the fresh data.

You can configure eventual consistency with the system properties below (same properties are valid for both member and client side Near Caches):

- `hazelcast.invalidation.max.tolerated.miss.count`: Default value is 10. If missed invalidation count is bigger than this value, relevant cached data will be made unreachable. 
- `hazelcast.invalidation.reconciliation.interval.seconds`: Default value is 60 seconds. This is a periodic task that scans cluster members periodically to compare generated invalidation events with the received ones from Near Cache.

===== Locally Initiated Changes

For local invalidations, when a record is updated/removed, future reads will see this update/remove to provide read-your-writes consistency. To achieve this consistency, Near Cache configuration provides two update policies:

- `INVALIDATE`
- `CACHE_ON_UPDATE`

If you choose `INVALIDATE`, the entry is removed from the Near Cache after the update/remove occurs in the underlying data structure and before the operation (get) returns to the caller. Until the update/remove operation completes, the entry's old value can still be read from the Near Cache.

If you choose `CACHE_ON_UPDATE`, the entry is updated after the update/remove occurs in the underlying data structure and before the operation (put/get) returns to the caller. If it is an update operation, it will remove the entry and the new value will be placed. Until the update/remove operation completes, the entry's old value can still be read from the Near Cache. Any threads reading the key after this point will read the new entry. If the mutative operation was a remove, the key will no longer exist in the Near Cache and the original copy in the member. 

==== Near Cache Preloader

The Near Cache preloader is a functionality to store the keys from a Near Cache to provide a fast re-population of the previous hot data set after a Hazelcast Client has been restarted. It is available on IMap and JCache clients.

The Near Cache preloader stores the keys (not the values) of Near Cache entries in regular intervals. You can define the initial delay via `store-initial-delay-seconds`, e.g., if you know that your hot data set will need some time to build up. You can configure the interval via `store-interval-seconds` which determines how often the key-set will be stored. The persistence will not run continuously. Whenever the storage is scheduled, it will be performed on the actual keys in the Near Cache.
 
The Near Cache preloader will be triggered on the first initialization of the data structure on the client, e.g., `client.getMap("myNearCacheMap")`. This schedules the preloader, which will work in the background, so your application is not blocked. The storage will be enabled after the loading is completed.

The configuration parameter `directory` is optional. If you omit it the base folder will be the user working directory (normally where the JVM was started or configured with the system property `user.dir`). The storage filenames will always be created from the Near Cache name. So even if you use a wildcard name in the Near Cache Configuration, the preloader filenames will be unique.

NOTE: If you run multiple Hazelcast clients with enabled Near Cache preloader on the same machine, you have to configure a unique storage filename for each client or run them from different user directories. If two clients would write into the same file, only the first client will succeed. The following clients will throw an exception as soon as the Near Cache preloader is triggered.


=== Caching Deserialized Values

There may be cases where you do not want to deserialize some values in your Hazelcast map again which were already deserialized previously. This way your query operations get faster. This is possible by using the `cache-deserialized-values` element in your declarative Hazelcast configuration, as shown below.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
   ...
   ...
   <map name="myMap">
      ...
      <in-memory-format>BINARY</in-memory-format>
      <cache-deserialized-values>INDEX-ONLY</cache-deserialized-values>
      <backup-count>1</backup-count>
      ...
   </map>
   ...
   ...
</hazelcast>
----

The element `cache-deserialized-values` controls the caching of deserialized values. Note that caching makes the query evaluation faster, but it will consume more memory. This element has the following values:

- NEVER: Deserialized values will never be cached.
- INDEX-ONLY: Deserialized values will be cached only when they are inserted into an index.
- ALWAYS: Deserialized values will always be cached.

If you are using portable serialization or your map's in-memory format is `OBJECT` or `NATIVE`, then `cache-deserialized-values` element does not have any effect.
