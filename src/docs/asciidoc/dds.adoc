== Distributed Data Structures

As mentioned in the <<hazelcast-overview, Overview section>>, Hazelcast offers distributed implementations of Java interfaces. Below is the list of these implementations with links to the corresponding sections in this manual.

* **Standard utility collections**
** <<map, Map>> is the distributed implementation of `java.util.Map`. It lets you read from and write to a Hazelcast map with methods such as `get` and `put`.
** <<queue, Queue>> is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`. You can add an item in one member and remove it from another one.
** <<ringbuffer, Ringbuffer>> is implemented for reliable eventing system.
** <<set, Set>> is the distributed and concurrent implementation of `java.util.Set`. It does not allow duplicate elements and does not preserve their order.
** <<list, List>> is similar to Hazelcast Set. The only difference is that it allows duplicate elements and preserves their order.
** <<multimap, Multimap>> is a specialized Hazelcast map. It is a distributed data structure where you can store multiple values for a single key.
** <<replicated-map, Replicated Map>> does not partition data. It does not spread data to different cluster members. Instead, it replicates the data to all members.
** <<cardinality-estimator, Cardinality Estimator>> is a data structure which implements Flajolet's HyperLogLog algorithm.
* **Topic** is the distributed mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers. It is also known as the publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model. Please see the <<topic, Topic section>> for more information. Hazelcast also has a structure called Reliable Topic which uses the same interface of Hazelcast Topic. The difference is that it is backed up by the Ringbuffer data structure. Please see the <<reliable-topic, Reliable Topic section>>.
* **Concurrency utilities**
** <<lock, Lock>> is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`. When you use lock, the critical section that Hazelcast Lock guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster.
** <<isemaphore, ISemaphore>> is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`. When performing concurrent activities, semaphores offer permits to control the thread counts.
** <<iatomiclong, IAtomicLong>> is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong`. Most of AtomicLong's operations are available. However, these operations involve remote calls and hence their performances differ from AtomicLong, due to being distributed.
** <<iatomicreference, IAtomicReference>> is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference`. When you need to deal with a reference in a distributed environment, you can use Hazelcast IAtomicReference. 
** <<idgenerator, IdGenerator>> is used to generate cluster-wide unique identifiers. ID generation occurs almost at the speed of `AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()`. This feature is deprecated, please use <<flakeidgenerator, FlakeIdGenerator>> instead.
** <<icountdownlatch, ICountdownLatch>> is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch`. Hazelcast CountDownLatch is a gate keeper for concurrent activities. It enables the threads to wait for other threads to complete their operations.
** <<pn-counter, PN counter>> is a distributed data structure where each Hazelcast instance can increment and decrement the counter value and these updates are propagated to all replicas.
* <<event-journal, Event Journal>> is a distributed data structure that stores the history of mutation actions on map or cache.


[[overview-of-hazelcast-distributed-objects]]
=== Overview of Hazelcast Distributed Objects

Hazelcast has two types of distributed objects in terms of their partitioning strategies:

. Data structures where each partition stores a part of the instance, namely partitioned data structures.
. Data structures where a single partition stores the whole instance, namely non-partitioned data structures.

Partitioned Hazelcast data structures are: 

* Map
* MultiMap
* Cache (Hazelcast JCache implementation)
* PN Counter
* Event Journal

Non-partitioned Hazelcast data structures are:

* Queue
* Set
* List
* Ringbuffer
* Lock
* ISemaphore
* IAtomicLong
* IAtomicReference
* FlakeIdGenerator
* ICountdownLatch
* Cardinality Estimator

Besides these, Hazelcast also offers the Replicated Map structure as explained in the above *Standard utility collections* list. 

[[loading-and-destroying-a-distributed-object]]
==== Loading and Destroying a Distributed Object

Hazelcast offers a `get` method for most of its distributed objects. To load an object, first create a Hazelcast instance and then use the related `get` method on this instance. Following example code snippet creates an Hazelcast instance and a map on this instance.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Map<Integer, String> customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( "customers" );
----

As to the configuration of distributed object, Hazelcast uses the default settings from the file `hazelcast.xml` that comes with your Hazelcast download. Of course, you can provide an explicit configuration in this XML or programmatically according to your needs. Please see the <<understanding-configuration, Understanding Configuration section>>.

Note that, most of Hazelcast's distributed objects are created lazily, i.e., a distributed object is created once the first operation accesses it.

If you want to use an object you loaded in other places, you can safely reload it using its reference without creating a new Hazelcast instance (`customers` in the above example).

To destroy a Hazelcast distributed object, you can use the method `destroy`. This method clears and releases all resources of the object. Therefore, you must use it with care since a reload with the same object reference after the object is destroyed creates a new data structure without an error. Please see the following example code where one of the queues are destroyed and the other one is accessed.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/MapMember.java[tag=mapmember]
----

If you start the `Member` above, the output will be as shown below:

```
q1.size: 1 q2.size:1
q1.size: 0 q2.size:0
```

As you see, no error is generated and a new queue resource is created.

[[controlling-partitions]]
==== Controlling Partitions

Hazelcast uses the name of a distributed object to determine which partition it will be put. Let's load two semaphores as shown below:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
ISemaphore s1 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore("s1");
ISemaphore s2 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore("s2");
----

Since these semaphores have different names, they will be placed into different partitions. If you want to put these two into the same partition, you use the `@` symbol as shown below:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
ISemaphore s1 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore("s1@foo");
ISemaphore s2 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore("s2@foo");
----

Now, these two semaphores will be put into the same partition whose partition key is `foo`. Note that you can use the method `getPartitionKey` to learn the partition key of a distributed object. It may be useful when you want to create an object in the same partition of an existing object. Please see its usage as shown below:

```
String partitionKey = s1.getPartitionKey();
ISemaphore s3 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore("s3@"+partitionKey);
```

[[common-features-of-all-hazelcast-data-structures]]
==== Common Features of all Hazelcast Data Structures

* If a member goes down, its backup replica (which holds the same data) will dynamically redistribute the data, including the ownership and locks on them, to the remaining live members. As a result, there will not be any data loss.
* There is no single cluster master that can be a single point of failure. Every member in the cluster has equal rights and responsibilities. No single member is superior. There is no dependency on an external 'server' or 'master'.

[[example-distributed-object-code]]
==== Example Distributed Object Code

Here is an example of how you can retrieve existing data structure instances (map, queue, set, lock, topic, etc.) and how you can listen for instance events, such as an instance being created or destroyed.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/SampleDOL.java[tag=sampledol]
----


[[map]]
=== Map

Hazelcast Map (`IMap`) extends the interface `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` and hence `java.util.Map`. It is the distributed implementation of Java map. You can perform operations like reading and writing from/to a Hazelcast map with the well known get and put methods.

'''
NOTE: IMap data structure can also be used by https://jet.hazelcast.org/[Hazelcast Jet] for Real-Time Stream Processing (by enabling the Event Journal on your map) and Fast Batch Processing. Hazelcast Jet uses IMap as a source (reads data from IMap) and as a sink (writes data to IMap). Please see the https://jet.hazelcast.org/use-cases/fast-batch-processing/[Fast Batch Processing] and https://jet.hazelcast.org/use-cases/real-time-stream-processing/[Real-Time Stream Processing] use cases for Hazelcast Jet. Please also see http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest/manual/#connector-imdg[here] in the Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual to learn how Jet uses IMap, i.e., how it can read from and write to IMap.


[[getting-a-map-and-putting-an-entry]]
==== Getting a Map and Putting an Entry

Hazelcast will partition your map entries and their backups, and almost evenly distribute them onto all Hazelcast members. Each member carries approximately "number of map entries * 2 * 1/n" entries, where **n** is the number of members in the cluster. For example, if you have a member with 1000 objects to be stored in the cluster and then you start a second member, each member will both store 500 objects and back up the 500 objects in the other member.

Let's create a Hazelcast instance and fill a map named `Capitals` with key-value pairs using the following code. Use the HazelcastInstance `getMap` method to get the map, then use the map `put` method to put an entry into the map.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hzInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Map<String, String> capitalcities = hzInstance.getMap( "capitals" ); 
    capitalcities.put( "1", "Tokyo" );
    capitalcities.put( "2", "Paris" );
    capitalcities.put( "3", "Washington" );
    capitalcities.put( "4", "Ankara" );
    capitalcities.put( "5", "Brussels" );
    capitalcities.put( "6", "Amsterdam" );
    capitalcities.put( "7", "New Delhi" );
    capitalcities.put( "8", "London" );
    capitalcities.put( "9", "Berlin" );
    capitalcities.put( "10", "Oslo" );
    capitalcities.put( "11", "Moscow" );
    ...
    capitalcities.put( "120", "Stockholm" );
----

When you run this code, a cluster member is created with a map whose entries are distributed across the members' partitions. See the below illustration. For now, this is a single member cluster.

image::1Node.png[Map Entries in a Single Member]

NOTE: Please note that some of the partitions will not contain any data entries since we only have 120 objects and the partition count is 271 by default. This count is configurable and can be changed using the system property `hazelcast.partition.count`. Please see the <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>>.

[[creating-a-member-for-map-backup]]
==== Creating A Member for Map Backup

Now let's create a second member by running the above code again. This will create a cluster with two members. This is also where backups of entries are created - remember the backup partitions mentioned in the <<hazelcast-overview, Hazelcast Overview section>>. The following illustration shows two members and how the data and its backup is distributed.

image::2Nodes.png[Map Entries with Backups in Two Members]

As you see, when a new member joins the cluster, it takes ownership and loads some of the data in the cluster. Eventually, it will carry almost "(1/n `*` total-data) + backups" of the data, reducing the load on other members.

`HazelcastInstance.getMap()` returns an instance of `com.hazelcast.core.IMap` which extends 
the `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` interface. Methods like 
`ConcurrentMap.putIfAbsent(key,value)` and `ConcurrentMap.replace(key,value)` can be used 
on the distributed map, as shown in the example below.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/BasicMapOperations.java[tag=bmo]
----

All `ConcurrentMap` operations such as `put` and `remove` might wait if the key is locked by another thread in the local or remote JVM. But, they will eventually return with success. `ConcurrentMap` operations never throw a `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException`.

Also see:

* <<data-affinity, Data Affinity section>>.
* <<using-wildcards, Map Configuration with wildcards>>.



[[backing-up-maps]]
==== Backing Up Maps

Hazelcast distributes map entries onto multiple cluster members (JVMs). Each member holds some portion of the data.

Distributed maps have one backup by default. If a member goes down, your data is recovered using the backups in the cluster. There are two types of backups as described below: _sync_ and _async_.

[[creating-sync-backups]]
===== Creating Sync Backups

To provide data safety, Hazelcast allows you to specify the number of backup copies you want to have. That way, data on a cluster member will be copied onto other member(s).

To create synchronous backups, select the number of backup copies using the `backup-count` property.

```
<hazelcast>
  <map name="default">
    <backup-count>1</backup-count>
  </map>
</hazelcast>
```

When this count is 1, a map entry will have its backup on one other member in the cluster. If you set it to 2, then a map entry will have its backup on two other members. You can set it to 0 if you do not want your entries to be backed up, e.g., if performance is more important than backing up. The maximum value for the backup count is 6.

Hazelcast supports both synchronous and asynchronous backups. By default, backup operations are synchronous and configured with `backup-count`. In this case, backup operations block operations until backups are successfully copied to backup members (or deleted from backup members in case of remove) and acknowledgements are received. Therefore, backups are updated before a `put` operation is completed, provided that the cluster is stable. Sync backup operations have a blocking cost which may lead to latency issues.

[[creating-async-backups]]
===== Creating Async Backups

Asynchronous backups, on the other hand, do not block operations. They are fire & forget and do not require acknowledgements; the backup operations are performed at some point in time.

To create asynchronous backups, select the number of async backups with the `async-backup-count` property. An example is shown below.


```
<hazelcast>
  <map name="default">
    <backup-count>0</backup-count>
    <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>
  </map>
</hazelcast>
```

See <<consistency-and-replication-model, Consistency and Replication Model>> for more detail.


NOTE: Backups increase memory usage since they are also kept in memory.

NOTE: A map can have both sync and async backups at the same time.


[[enabling-backup-reads]]
===== Enabling Backup Reads

By default, Hazelcast has one sync backup copy. If `backup-count` is set to more than 1, then each member will carry both owned entries and backup copies of other members. So for the `map.get(key)` call, it is possible that the calling member has a backup copy of that key. By default, `map.get(key)` will always read the value from the actual owner of the key for consistency.

To enable backup reads (read local backup entries), set the value of the `read-backup-data` property to **true**. Its default value is **false** for consistency. Enabling backup reads can improve performance but on the other hand it can cause stale reads while still preserving monotonic-reads property.

```
<hazelcast>
  <map name="default">
    <backup-count>0</backup-count>
    <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>
    <read-backup-data>true</read-backup-data>
  </map>
</hazelcast>
```

This feature is available when there is at least one sync or async backup.

Please note that if you are performing a read from a backup, you should take into account that your hits to the keys in the backups are not reflected as hits to the original keys on the primary members. This has an impact on IMap's maximum idle seconds or time-to-live seconds expiration. Therefore, even though there is a hit on a key in backups, your original key on the primary member may expire.

[[map-eviction]]
==== Map Eviction

NOTE: Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, Hazelcast Map uses a new eviction mechanism which is based on the sampling of entries. Please see the <<eviction-algorithm, Eviction Algorithm section>> for details.

Unless you delete the map entries manually or use an eviction policy, they will remain in the map. Hazelcast supports policy-based eviction for distributed maps. Currently supported policies are LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used).

[[understanding-map-eviction]]
===== Understanding Map Eviction

Hazelcast Map performs eviction based on partitions. For example, when you specify a size using the `PER_NODE` attribute for `max-size` (please see <<configuring-map-eviction, Configuring Map Eviction>>), Hazelcast internally calculates the maximum size for every partition. Hazelcast uses the following equation to calculate the maximum size of a partition:

```
partition-maximum-size = max-size * member-count / partition-count
```

NOTE: If the `partition-maximum-size` is less than 1 in the equation above, it will be set to 1 (otherwise, the partitions would be emptied immediately by eviction due to the exceedance of `max-size` being less than 1).

The eviction process starts according to this calculated partition maximum size when you try to put an entry. When entry count in that partition exceeds partition maximum size, eviction starts on that partition.

Assume that you have the following figures as examples:

* Partition count: 200
* Entry count for each partition: 100
* `max-size` (PER_NODE): 20000

The total number of entries here is 20000 (partition count * entry count for each partition). This means you are at the eviction threshold since you set the `max-size` to 20000. When you try to put an entry

. the entry goes to the relevant partition;
. the partition checks whether the eviction threshold is reached (`max-size`);
. only one entry will be evicted.

As a result of this eviction process, when you check the size of your map, it is 19999. After this eviction, subsequent put operations will not trigger the next eviction until the map size is again close to the `max-size`.

NOTE: The above scenario is simply an example that describes how the eviction process works. Hazelcast finds the most optimum number of entries to be evicted according to your cluster size and selected policy.

[[configuring-map-eviction]]
===== Configuring Map Eviction

The following is an example declarative configuration for map eviction.

```
<hazelcast>
  <map name="default">
    ...
    <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>
    <max-idle-seconds>0</max-idle-seconds>
    <eviction-policy>LRU</eviction-policy>
    <max-size policy="PER_NODE">5000</max-size>
    ...
  </map>
</hazelcast>
```

Let's describe each element:

* `time-to-live-seconds`: Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay in the map (TTL). It limits the lifetime of the entries relative to the time of the last write access performed on them. If it is not 0, the entries whose lifetime exceeds this period (without any write access performed on them during this period) are expired and evicted automatically. An individual entry may have its own lifetime limit by using one of the methods accepting a TTL; see <<evicting-specific-entries, Evicting Specific Entries section>>. If there is no TTL value provided for the individual entry, it inherits the value set for this element. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`. Its default value is 0, which means infinite (no expiration and eviction). If it is not 0, entries are evicted regardless of the set `eviction-policy` described below.
* `max-idle-seconds`: Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay idle in the map. It limits the lifetime of the entries relative to the time of the last read or write access performed on them. The entries whose idle period exceeds this limit are expired and evicted automatically. An entry is idle if no `get`, `put`, `EntryProcessor.process` or `containsKey` is called on it. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`. Its default value is 0, which means infinite.
+
NOTE: Both `time-to-live-seconds` and `max-idle-seconds` may be used simultaneously on the map entries. In that case, the entry is considered expired if at least one of the policies marks it as expired.
+
* `eviction-policy`: Eviction policy to be applied when the size of map grows larger than the value specified by the `max-size` element described below.  Valid values are:
** NONE: Default policy. If set, no items will be evicted and the property `max-size` described below will be ignored. You still can combine it with `time-to-live-seconds` and `max-idle-seconds`.
** LRU: Least Recently Used.
** LFU: Least Frequently Used.
+
Apart from the above values, you can also develop and use your own eviction policy. Please see the <<custom-eviction-policy, Custom Eviction Policy section>>.
+
* `max-size`: Maximum size of the map. When maximum size is reached, the map is evicted based on the policy defined. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`. Its default value is 0, which means infinite. If you want `max-size` to work, set the `eviction-policy` property to a value other than NONE. Its attributes are described below.
** `PER_NODE`: Maximum number of map entries in each cluster member. This is the default policy.		
+
`<max-size policy="PER_NODE">5000</max-size>`
+
** `PER_PARTITION`: Maximum number of map entries within each partition. Storage size depends on the partition count in a cluster member. This attribute should not be used often. For instance, avoid using this attribute with a small cluster. If the cluster is small, it will be hosting more partitions, and therefore map entries, than that of a larger cluster. Thus, for a small cluster, eviction of the entries will decrease performance (the number of entries is large).
+
`<max-size policy="PER_PARTITION">27100</max-size>`
+
** `USED_HEAP_SIZE`: Maximum used heap size in megabytes per map for each Hazelcast instance. Please note that this policy does not work when <<setting-in-memory-format, in-memory format>> is set to `OBJECT`, since the memory footprint cannot be determined when data is put as `OBJECT`.
+
`<max-size policy="USED_HEAP_SIZE">4096</max-size>`
+
** `USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE`: Maximum used heap size percentage per map for each Hazelcast instance. If, for example, a JVM is configured to have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries will be evicted when used heap size exceeds 100 MB. Please note that this policy does not work when <<setting-in-memory-format, in-memory format>> is set to `OBJECT`, since the memory footprint cannot be determined when data is put as `OBJECT`.
+
`<max-size policy="USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE">10</max-size>`
+
** `FREE_HEAP_SIZE`: Minimum free heap size in megabytes for each JVM.
+
`<max-size policy="FREE_HEAP_SIZE">512</max-size>`
+
** `FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE`: Minimum free heap size percentage for each JVM. If, for example, a JVM is configured to have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries will be evicted when free heap size is below 100 MB.
+
`<max-size policy="FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE">10</max-size>`
+
** `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*) Maximum used native memory size in megabytes per map for each Hazelcast instance.
+
`<max-size policy="USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE">1024</max-size>`
+
** `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*) Maximum used native memory size percentage per map for each Hazelcast instance.
+
`<max-size policy="USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE">65</max-size>`
+
** `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*) Minimum free native memory size in megabytes for each Hazelcast instance.
+
`<max-size policy="FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE">256</max-size>`
+
** `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*) Minimum free native memory size percentage for each Hazelcast instance.
+
`<max-size policy="FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE">5</max-size>`


NOTE: As of Hazelcast 3.7, the elements `eviction-percentage` and `min-eviction-check-millis` are deprecated. They will be ignored if configured since map eviction is based on the sampling of entries. Please see the <<eviction-algorithm, Eviction Algorithm section>> for details.

To put it briefly, Hazelcast maps have no restrictions on the size and may grow arbitrarily large, by default. When it comes to reducing the size of a map, there are two concepts: expiration and eviction.

Expiration puts a limit on the maximum lifetime of an entry stored inside the map. When the entry expires it cannot be retrieved from the map any longer and at some point in time it will be cleaned out from the map to free up the memory. Expiration, and hence the eviction based on the expiration, can be configured using the element `time-to-live-seconds- and `max-idle-seconds` as described above.

Eviction puts a limit on the maximum size of the map. If the size of the map grows larger than the maximum allowed size, an eviction policy decides which item to evict from the map to reduce its size. The maximum allowed size can be configured using the element `max-size` and the eviction policy can be configured using the element `eviction-policy` as described above.

Eviction and expiration can be used together. In this case, the expiration configurations (`time-to-live-seconds- and `max-idle-seconds`) continue to work as usual cleaning out the expired entries regardless of the map size. Note that locked map entries are not the subjects for eviction and expiration.

[[example-eviction-configurations]]
===== Example Eviction Configurations

```
<map name="documents">
  <max-size policy="PER_NODE">10000</max-size>
  <eviction-policy>LRU</eviction-policy>
  <max-idle-seconds>60</max-idle-seconds>
</map>
```

In the above example, `documents` map starts to evict its entries from a member when the map size exceeds 10000 in that member. Then the entries least recently used will be evicted. The entries not used for more than 60 seconds will be evicted as well.

And the following is an example eviction configuration for a map having `NATIVE` as the in-memory format:

```
<map name="nativeMap*">
    <in-memory-format>NATIVE</in-memory-format>
    <eviction-policy>LFU</eviction-policy>
    <max-size policy="USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE">99</max-size>
</map>
```

[[evicting-specific-entries]]
===== Evicting Specific Entries

The eviction policies and configurations explained above apply to all the entries of a map. The entries that meet the specified eviction conditions are evicted.

You may also want to evict some specific map entries.  To do this, you can use the `ttl` and `timeunit` parameters of the method `map.put()`. An example code line is given below.

`myMap.put( "1", "John", 50, TimeUnit.SECONDS )`

The map entry with the key "1" will be evicted 50 seconds after it is put into `myMap`.

You may also use `map.setTTL` method to alter the time-to-live value of an existing entry. It is done as follows:

`myMap.setTTL( "1", 50, TimeUnit.SECONDS )`

[[evicting-all-entries]]
===== Evicting All Entries

To evict all keys from the map except the locked ones, use the method `evictAll()`. If a MapStore is defined for the map, `deleteAll` is not called by `evictAll`. If you want to call the method `deleteAll`, use `clear()`.

An example is given below.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/EvictAll.java[tag=evictall]
----



NOTE: Only EVICT_ALL event is fired for any registered listeners.

[[forced-eviction]]
===== Forced Eviction

[blue]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise*


Hazelcast may use forced eviction in the cases when the eviction explained in <<understanding-map-eviction, Understanding Map Eviction>> is not enough to free up your memory. Note that this is valid if you are using [blue]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise* and you set your in-memory format to `NATIVE`.

Forced eviction mechanism is explained below as steps in the given order:

* When the normal eviction is not enough, forced eviction is triggered and first it tries to evict approx. 20% of the entries from the current partition. It retries this five times.
* If the result of above step is still not enough, forced eviction applies the above step to all maps. This time it might perform eviction from some other partitions too, provided that they are owned by the same thread.
* If that is still not enough to free up your memory, it evicts not the 20% but all the entries from the current partition.
* if that is not enough, it will evict all the entries from the other data structures; from the partitions owned by the local thread.

Finally, when all the above steps are not enough, Hazelcast throws a  Native Out of Memory Exception.

[[custom-eviction-policy]]
===== Custom Eviction Policy

NOTE: This section is valid for Hazelcast 3.7 and higher releases.


Apart from the policies such as LRU and LFU, which Hazelcast provides out-of-the-box, you can develop and use your own eviction policy. 

To achieve this, you need to provide an implementation of `MapEvictionPolicy` as in the following `OddEvictor` example:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/MapCustomEvictionPolicy.java[tag=mcep]
----

Then you can enable your policy by setting it via the method `MapConfig.setMapEvictionPolicy()`
programmatically or via XML declaratively. Following is the example declarative configuration for the eviction policy `OddEvictor` implemented above:

```
<map name="test">
   ...
   <map-eviction-policy-class-name>com.package.OddEvictor</map-eviction-policy-class-name>
   ....
</map>
```

If you Hazelcast with Spring, you can enable your policy as shown below.

```
<hz:map name="test">
    <hz:map-eviction-policy class-name="com.package.OddEvictor"/>
</hz:map>
```

[[setting-in-memory-format]]
==== Setting In-Memory Format

IMap (and a few other Hazelcast data structures, such as ICache) has an `in-memory-format` configuration option. By default, Hazelcast stores data into memory in binary (serialized) format. Sometimes it can be efficient to store the entries in their object form, especially in cases of local processing, such as entry processor and queries.

To set how the data will be stored in memory, set `in-memory-format` in the configuration. You have the following format options:

* `BINARY` (default): The data (both the key and value) will be stored in serialized binary format. You can use this option if you mostly perform regular map operations, such as `put` and `get`.
* `OBJECT`: The data will be stored in deserialized form. This configuration is good for maps where entry processing and queries form the majority of all operations and the objects are complex, making the serialization cost comparatively high. By storing objects, entry processing will not contain the deserialization cost. Note that when you use `OBJECT` as the in-memory format, the key will still be stored in binary format and the value will be stored in object format.
* `NATIVE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*) This format behaves the same as BINARY, however, instead of heap memory, key and value will be stored in the off-heap memory.

Regular operations like `get` rely on the object instance. When the `OBJECT` format is used and a `get` is performed, the map does not return the stored instance, but creates a clone. Therefore, this whole `get` operation first includes a serialization on the member owning the instance and then a deserialization on the member calling the instance. When the `BINARY` format is used, only a deserialization is required; `BINARY` is faster.

Similarly, a `put` operation is faster when the `BINARY` format is used. If the format was `OBJECT`, the map would create a clone of the instance, and there would first be a serialization and then a deserialization. When BINARY is used, only a deserialization is needed.

NOTE: If a value is stored in `OBJECT` format, a change on a returned value does not affect the stored instance. In this case, the returned instance is not the actual one but a clone. Therefore, changes made on an object after it is returned will not reflect on the actual stored data. Similarly, when a value is written to a map and the value is stored in `OBJECT` format, it will be a copy of the `put` value. Therefore, changes made on the object after it is stored will not reflect on the stored data.

[[using-high-density-memory-store-with-map]]
==== Using High-Density Memory Store with Map

[navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*

Hazelcast instances are Java programs. In case of `BINARY` and `OBJECT` in-memory formats, Hazelcast stores your distributed data into the heap of its server instances. Java heap is subject to garbage collection (GC). In case of larger heaps, garbage collection might cause your application to pause for tens of seconds (even minutes for really large heaps), badly affecting your application performance and response times.

As the data gets bigger, you either run the application with larger heap, which would result in longer GC pauses or run multiple instances with smaller heap which can turn into an operational nightmare if the number of such instances becomes very high.

To overcome this challenge, Hazelcast offers High-Density Memory Store for your maps. You can configure your map to use High-Density Memory Store by setting the in-memory format to `NATIVE`. The following snippet is the declarative configuration example.

```
<map name="nativeMap*">
   <in-memory-format>NATIVE</in-memory-format>
</map>
```

Keep in mind that you should have already enabled the High-Density Memory Store usage for your cluster. Please see <<configuring-high-density-memory-store, Configuring High-Density Memory Store section>>.

[[required-configuration-changes-when-using-native]]
===== Required configuration changes when using NATIVE

Note that the eviction mechanism is different for `NATIVE` in-memory format.
The new eviction algorithm for map with High-Density Memory Store is similar to that of JCache with High-Density Memory Store and is described <<eviction-algorithm, here>>.

* Eviction percentage has no effect.
+
```
<map name="nativeMap*">
    <in-memory-format>NATIVE</in-memory-format>
    <eviction-percentage>25</eviction-percentage> <--! NO IMPACT with NATIVE -->
</map>
```
+
* These IMap eviction policies for `max-size` cannot be used: `FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE`, `FREE_HEAP_SIZE`, `USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE`, `USED_HEAP_SIZE`.
* Near Cache eviction configuration is also different for `NATIVE` in-memory format. For a Near Cache configuration with in-memory format set to `BINARY`:
+    
```
<map name="nativeMap*">
   <near-cache>
      <in-memory-format>BINARY</in-memory-format>
      <max-size>10000</max-size> <--! NO IMPACT with NATIVE -->
      <eviction-policy>LFU</eviction-policy> <--! NO IMPACT with NATIVE -->
   </near-cache>
</map>
```
+
the equivalent configuration for `NATIVE` in-memory format would be similar to the following:
+
```
<map name="nativeMap*">
   <near-cache>
      <in-memory-format>NATIVE</in-memory-format>
      <eviction size="10000" eviction-policy="LFU" max-size-policy="USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE"/>   <--! Correct configuration with NATIVE -->
   </near-cache>
</map>
```
+
* Near Cache eviction policy `ENTRY_COUNT` cannot be used for `max-size-policy`.


NOTE: Please refer to the <<high-density-memory-store, High-Density Memory Store section>> for more information.

[[loading-and-storing-persistent-data]]
==== Loading and Storing Persistent Data

Hazelcast allows you to load and store the distributed map entries from/to a persistent data store such as a relational database. To do this, you can use Hazelcast's `MapStore` and `MapLoader` interfaces.

When you provide a `MapLoader` implementation and request an entry (`IMap.get()`) that does not exist in memory, `MapLoader`'s `load` method will load that entry from the data store. This loaded entry is placed into the map and will stay there until it is removed or evicted.

When a `MapStore` implementation is provided, an entry is also put into a user defined data store. 

NOTE: Data store needs to be a centralized system that is
accessible from all Hazelcast members. Persistence to a local file system is not supported.

NOTE: Also note that the `MapStore` interface extends the `MapLoader` interface as you can see in the interface http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/MapStore.html[code].

NOTE: Starting with Hazelcast IMDG 3.11, all loads can be listened via `EntryLoadedListener`.


Following is a `MapStore` example.


[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/PersonMapStore.java[tag=personms]
----

NOTE: During the initial loading process, MapStore uses a thread different from the partition threads that are used by the ExecutorService. After the initialization is completed, the `map.get` method looks up any nonexistent value from the database in a partition thread, or the `map.put` method looks up the database to return the previously associated value for a key also in a partition thread.


NOTE: For more MapStore/MapLoader code samples, please see https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/distributed-map/mapstore/src/main/java[here].

Hazelcast supports read-through, write-through and write-behind persistence modes, which are explained in the subsections below.

[[using-read-through-persistence]]
===== Using Read-Through Persistence

If an entry does not exist in memory when an application asks for it, Hazelcast asks the loader implementation to load that entry from the data store.  If the entry exists there, the loader implementation gets it, hands it to Hazelcast, and Hazelcast puts it into memory. This is read-through persistence mode.

[[setting-write-through-persistence]]
===== Setting Write-Through Persistence

`MapStore` can be configured to be write-through by setting the `write-delay-seconds` property to **0**. This means the entries will be put to the data store synchronously.

In this mode, when the `map.put(key,value)` call returns:

* `MapStore.store(key,value)` is successfully called so the entry is persisted.
* In-Memory entry is updated.
* In-Memory backup copies are successfully created on other cluster members (if `backup-count` is greater than 0).

If `MapStore` throws an exception then the exception is propagated to the original `put` or `remove` call in the form of `RuntimeException`.

NOTE: There is a key difference in the behaviors of `map.remove(key)` and `map.delete(key)`, i.e., the latter results in `MapStore.delete(key)` to be invoked whereas the former only removes the entry from IMap.

[[setting-write-behind-persistence]]
===== Setting Write-Behind Persistence

You can configure `MapStore` as write-behind by setting the `write-delay-seconds` property to a value bigger than **0**. This means the modified entries will be put to the data store asynchronously after a configured delay. 

NOTE: In write-behind mode, Hazelcast coalesces updates on a specific key by default, which means it applies only the last update on that key. However, you can set `MapStoreConfig.setWriteCoalescing()` to `FALSE` and you can store all updates performed on a key to the data store.

NOTE: When you set `MapStoreConfig.setWriteCoalescing()` to `FALSE`, after you reached per-node maximum write-behind-queue capacity, subsequent put operations will fail with `ReachedMaxSizeException`. This exception will be thrown to prevent uncontrolled grow of write-behind queues. You can set per-node maximum capacity using the system property `hazelcast.map.write.behind.queue.capacity`. Please refer to the <<system-properties, System Properties section>> for information on this property and how to set the system properties.


In write-behind mode, when the `map.put(key,value)` call returns:

* In-Memory entry is updated.
* In-Memory backup copies are successfully created on other cluster members (if `backup-count` is greater than 0).
* The entry is marked as dirty so that after `write-delay-seconds`, it can be persisted with `MapStore.store(key,value)` call.
* For fault tolerance, dirty entries are stored in a queue on the primary member and also on a back-up member.

The same behavior goes for the `map.remove(key)`, the only difference is that  `MapStore.delete(key)` is called when the entry will be deleted.

If `MapStore` throws an exception, then Hazelcast tries to store the entry again. If the entry still cannot be stored, a log message is printed and the entry is re-queued. 

For batch write operations, which are only allowed in write-behind mode, Hazelcast will call `MapStore.storeAll(map)` and `MapStore.deleteAll(collection)` to do all writes in a single call.

NOTE: If a map entry is marked as dirty, meaning that it is waiting to be persisted to the `MapStore` in a write-behind scenario, the eviction process forces the entry to be stored. This way you have control over the number of entries waiting to be stored, and thus you can prevent a possible OutOfMemory exception.

NOTE: `MapStore` or `MapLoader` implementations should not use Hazelcast Map/Queue/MultiMap/List/Set operations. Your implementation should only work with your data store. Otherwise, you may get into deadlock situations.

Here is a sample configuration:

```
<hazelcast>
  ...
  <map name="default">
    ...
    <map-store enabled="true" initial-mode="LAZY">
      <class-name>com.hazelcast.examples.DummyStore</class-name>
      <write-delay-seconds>60</write-delay-seconds>
      <write-batch-size>1000</write-batch-size>
      <write-coalescing>true</write-coalescing>
    </map-store>
  </map>
</hazelcast>
```

The following are the descriptions of MapStore configuration elements and attributes:

* `class-name`: Name of the class implementing MapLoader and/or MapStore.
* `write-delay-seconds`: Number of seconds to delay to call the MapStore.store(key, value). If the value is zero then it is write-through so MapStore.store(key, value) will be called as soon as the entry is updated. Otherwise it is write-behind so updates will be stored after write-delay-seconds value by calling Hazelcast.storeAll(map). Its default value is 0.
* `write-batch-size`: Used to create batch chunks when writing map store. In default mode, all map entries will be tried to be written in one go. To create batch chunks, the minimum meaningful value for write-batch-size is 2. For values smaller than 2, it works as in default mode.
* `write-coalescing`: In write-behind mode, Hazelcast coalesces updates on a specific key by default; it applies only the last update on it. You can set this element to `false` to store all updates performed on a key to the data store.
* `enabled`: True to enable this map-store, false to disable. Its default value is true.
* `initial-mode`: Sets the initial load mode. LAZY is the default load mode, where load is asynchronous. EAGER means load is blocked till all partitions are loaded. Please see the <<initializing-map-on-startup, Initializing Map on Startup section>> for more details.

[[storing-entries-to-multiple-maps]]
===== Storing Entries to Multiple Maps

A configuration can be applied to more than one map using wildcards (see <<using-wildcards, Using Wildcards>>), meaning that the configuration is shared among the maps. But `MapStore` does not know which entries to store when there is one configuration applied to multiple maps.

To store entries when there is one configuration applied to multiple maps, use Hazelcast's `MapStoreFactory` interface. Using the `MapStoreFactory` interface, `MapStore`s for each map can be created when a wildcard configuration is used. Example code is shown below.

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig( "*" );
MapStoreConfig mapStoreConfig = mapConfig.getMapStoreConfig();
mapStoreConfig.setFactoryImplementation( new MapStoreFactory<Object, Object>() {
  @Override
  public MapLoader<Object, Object> newMapStore( String mapName, Properties properties ) {
    return null;
  }
});
----

To initialize the `MapLoader` implementation with the given map name, configuration properties and the Hazelcast instance, implement the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/MapLoaderLifecycleSupport.html[`MapLoaderLifecycleSupport` interface]. This interface has the methods `init()` and `destroy()`.

The method `init()` initializes the `MapLoader` implementation. Hazelcast calls this method when the map is first used on the Hazelcast instance. The `MapLoader` implementation can initialize the required resources for implementing `MapLoader` such as reading a configuration file or creating a database connection.

Hazelcast calls the method `destroy()` before shutting down. You can override this method  to cleanup the resources held by this `MapLoader` implementation, such as closing the database connections.

[[initializing-map-on-startup]]
===== Initializing Map on Startup

To pre-populate the in-memory map when the map is first touched/used, use the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` API.

If `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` returns NULL, then nothing will be loaded. Your `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` implementation can return all or some of the keys. For example, you may select and return only the keys which are most important to you that you want to load them while initializing the map. `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` is the fastest way of pre-populating the map since Hazelcast will optimize the loading process by having each cluster member load its owned portion of the entries.

The `InitialLoadMode` configuration parameter in the class http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/MapStoreConfig.html[MapStoreConfig] has two values: `LAZY` and `EAGER`. If `InitialLoadMode` is set to `LAZY`, data is not loaded during the map creation. If it is set to `EAGER`, all the data is loaded while the map is created and everything becomes ready to use. Also, if you add indices to your map with the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/MapIndexConfig.html[MapIndexConfig] class or the <<indexing-queries, `addIndex`>> method, then `InitialLoadMode` is overridden and `MapStoreConfig` behaves as if `EAGER` mode is on.

Here is the `MapLoader` initialization flow:

. When `getMap()` is first called from any member, initialization will start depending on the value of `InitialLoadMode`. If it is set to `EAGER`, initialization starts on all partitions as soon as the map is touched, i.e., all partitions will be loaded when `getMap` is called.  If it is set to `LAZY`, data will be loaded partition by partition, i.e., each partition will be loaded with its first touch.
. Hazelcast will call `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` to get all your keys on one of the members.
. That member will distribute keys to all other members in batches.
. Each member will load values of all its owned keys by calling `MapLoader.loadAll(keys)`.
. Each member puts its owned entries into the map by calling `IMap.putTransient(key,value)`.

NOTE: If the load mode is `LAZY` and the `clear()` method is called (which triggers `MapStore.deleteAll()`), Hazelcast will remove **ONLY** the loaded entries from your map and datastore. Since all the data is not loaded in this case (`LAZY` mode), please note that there may still be entries in your datastore.*

NOTE: If you do not want the MapStore start to load as soon as the first cluster member starts, you can use the system property `hazelcast.initial.min.cluster.size`. For example, if you set its value as `3`, loading process will be blocked until all three members are completely up.*


NOTE: The return type of `loadAllKeys()` is changed from `Set` to `Iterable` with the release of Hazelcast 3.5. MapLoader implementations from previous releases are also supported and do not need to be adapted.

[[loading-keys-incrementally]]
===== Loading Keys Incrementally

If the number of keys to load is large, it is more efficient to load them incrementally rather than loading them all at once. To support incremental loading, the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method returns an `Iterable` which can be lazily populated with the results of a database query. 

Hazelcast iterates over the `Iterable` and, while doing so, sends out the keys to their respective owner members. The `Iterator` obtained from `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` may also implement the `Closeable` interface, in which case `Iterator` is closed once the iteration is over. This is intended for releasing resources such as closing a JDBC result set. 

[[forcing-all-keys-to-be-loaded]]
===== Forcing All Keys To Be Loaded

The method `loadAll` loads some or all keys into a data store in order to optimize the multiple load operations. The method has two signatures; the same method can take two different parameter lists. One signature loads the given keys and the other loads all keys. Please see the example code below.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/LoadAll.java[tag=loadall]
----

[[post-processing-objects-in-map-store]]
===== Post-Processing Objects in Map Store

In some scenarios, you may need to modify the object after storing it into the map store.
For example, you can get an ID or version auto-generated by your database and then need to modify your object stored in the distributed map, but not to break the synchronization between the database and the data grid. 

To post-process an object in the map store, implement the `PostProcessingMapStore` interface to put the modified object into the distributed map. This will trigger an extra step of `Serialization`, so use it only when needed. (This is only valid when using the `write-through` map store configuration.)

Here is an example of post processing map store:

[source,java]
----
class ProcessingStore implements MapStore<Integer, Employee>, PostProcessingMapStore {
    @Override
    public void store( Integer key, Employee employee ) {
        EmployeeId id = saveEmployee();
        employee.setId( id.getId() );
    }
}
----

NOTE: Please note that if you are using a post processing map store in combination with entry processors, post-processed values will not be carried to backups.

[[accessing-a-database-using-properties]]
===== Accessing a Database Using `Properties`

You can prepare your own `MapLoader` to access a database such as Cassandra and MongoDB. For this, you can first declaratively specify the database properties in your `hazelcast.xml` configuration file and then implement the `MapLoaderLifecycleSupport` interface to pass those properties.

You can define the database properties, such as its URL and name, using the `properties` configuration element. The following is a configuration example for MongoDB:

```
    <map name="supplements">
        <map-store enabled="true" initial-mode="LAZY">
            <class-name>com.hazelcast.loader.YourMapStoreImplementation</class-name>
            <properties>
                <property name="mongo.url">mongodb://localhost:27017</property>
                <property name="mongo.db">mydb</property>
                <property name="mongo.collection">supplements</property>
            </properties>
        </map-store>
    </map>
```

After you specified the database properties in your configuration, you need to implement the `MapLoaderLifecycleSupport` interface and give those properties in the `init()` method, as shown below:



[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/YourMapStoreImplementation.java[tag=ymsi]
----


You can refer to the full example https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/mongodb[here].

[[creating-near-cache-for-map]]
==== Creating Near Cache for Map

The Hazelcast distributed map supports a local Near Cache for remotely stored entries to increase the performance of local read operations. Please refer to the <<near-cache, Near Cache section>> for a detailed explanation of the Near Cache feature and its configuration.


[[locking-maps]]
==== Locking Maps

Hazelcast Distributed Map (IMap) is thread-safe to meet your thread safety requirements. When these requirements increase or you want to have more control on the concurrency, consider the Hazelcast solutions described here.

Let's work on a sample case as shown below.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/RacyUpdateMember.java[tag=racy]
----

If the above code is run by more than one cluster member simultaneously, a race condition is likely. You can solve this condition with Hazelcast using either pessimistic locking or optimistic locking. 

[[pessimistic-looking]]
===== Pessimistic Locking

One way to solve the race issue is by using pessimistic locking - lock the map entry until you are finished with it.

To perform pessimistic locking, use the lock mechanism provided by the Hazelcast distributed map, i.e., the `map.lock` and `map.unlock` methods. See the below example code.


[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/PessimisticUpdateMember.java[tag=pum]
----


The IMap lock will automatically be collected by the garbage collector when the lock is released and no other waiting conditions exist on the lock.

The IMap lock is reentrant, but it does not support fairness.

Another way to solve the race issue is by acquiring a predictable `Lock` object from Hazelcast. This way, every value in the map can be given a lock, or you can create a stripe of locks.

[[optimistic-locking]]
===== Optimistic Locking

In Hazelcast, you can apply the optimistic locking strategy with the map's `replace` method. This method compares values in object or data forms depending on the in-memory format configuration. If the values are equal, it replaces the old value with the new one. If you want to use your defined `equals` method, `in-memory-format` should be `OBJECT`. Otherwise, Hazelcast serializes objects to `BINARY` forms and compares them.

See the below example code.

NOTE: The below example code is intentionally broken.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/OptimisticMember.java[tag=om]
----


[[pessimistic-vs-optimistic-locking]]
===== Pessimistic vs. Optimistic Locking

The locking strategy you choose will depend on your locking requirements.

Optimistic locking is better for mostly read-only systems. It has a performance boost over pessimistic locking.

Pessimistic locking is good if there are lots of updates on the same key. It is more robust than optimistic locking from the perspective of data consistency.

In Hazelcast, use `IExecutorService` to submit a task to a key owner, or to a member or members. This is the recommended way to perform task executions, rather than using pessimistic or optimistic locking techniques. `IExecutorService` will have fewer network hops and less data over wire, and tasks will be executed very near to the data. Please refer to the <<data-affinity, Data Affinity section>>.

[[solving-the-aba-problem]]
===== Solving the ABA Problem

The ABA problem occurs in environments when a shared resource is open to change by multiple threads. Even if one thread sees the same value for a particular key in consecutive reads, it does not mean that nothing has changed between the reads. Another thread may change the value, do work and change the value back, while the first thread thinks that nothing has changed.

To prevent these kind of problems, you can assign a version number and check it before any write to be sure that nothing has changed between consecutive reads. Although all the other fields will be equal, the version field will prevent objects from being seen as equal. This is the optimistic locking strategy; it is used in environments that do not expect intensive concurrent changes on a specific key.

In Hazelcast, you can apply the <<optimistic-locking, optimistic locking>> strategy with the map `replace` method.

[[lock-split-brain-protection-with-pessimistic-locking]]
===== Lock Split-Brain Protection with Pessimistic Locking

Locks can be configured to check the number of currently present members before applying a locking operation. If the check fails, the lock operation will fail with a `QuorumException` (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). As pessimistic locking uses lock operations internally, it will also use the configured lock quorum. This means that you can configure a lock quorum with the same name or a pattern that matches the map name. Note that the quorum for IMap locking actions can be different from the quorum for other IMap actions.  

The following actions will then check for lock quorum before being applied:
 
* `IMap.lock(K)` and `IMap.lock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`
* `IMap.isLocked()`
* `IMap.tryLock(K)`, `IMap.tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` and `IMap.tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`
* `IMap.unlock()`
* `IMap.forceUnlock()`
* `MultiMap.lock(K)` and `MultiMap.lock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`
* `MultiMap.isLocked()`
* `MultiMap.tryLock(K)`, `MultiMap.tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` and `MultiMap.tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`
* `MultiMap.unlock()`
* `MultiMap.forceUnlock()`

An example of declarative configuration:
 
```
<map name="myMap">
  <quorum-ref>map-actions-quorum</quorum-ref>
</map>

<lock name="myMap">
    <quorum-ref>map-lock-actions-quorum</quorum-ref>
</lock>
```

Here the configured map will use the `map-lock-actions-quorum` quorum for map lock actions and the `map-actions-quorum` quorum for other map actions.


[[accessing-entry-statistics]]
==== Accessing Entry Statistics

Hazelcast keeps statistics about each map entry, such as creation time, last update time, last access time, number of hits and version. To access the map entry statistics, use an `IMap.getEntryView(key)` call. Here is an example.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
EntryView entry = hz.getMap( "quotes" ).getEntryView( "1" );
System.out.println ( "size in memory  : " + entry.getCost() );
System.out.println ( "creationTime    : " + entry.getCreationTime() );
System.out.println ( "expirationTime  : " + entry.getExpirationTime() );
System.out.println ( "number of hits  : " + entry.getHits() );
System.out.println ( "lastAccessedTime: " + entry.getLastAccessTime() );
System.out.println ( "lastUpdateTime  : " + entry.getLastUpdateTime() );
System.out.println ( "version         : " + entry.getVersion() );
System.out.println ( "key             : " + entry.getKey() );
System.out.println ( "value           : " + entry.getValue() );
----

[[map-listener]]
==== Map Listener

Please refer to the <<listening-for-map-events, Listening for Map Events section>>.


[[listening-to-map-entries-with-predicates]]
==== Listening to Map Entries with Predicates

You can listen to the modifications performed on specific map entries. You can think of it as an entry listener with predicates. Please see the <<listening-for-map-events, Listening for Map Events section>> for information on how to add entry listeners to a map.


NOTE: The default backwards-compatible event publishing strategy only publishes
`UPDATED` events when map entries are updated to a value that matches the predicate with which the listener was registered.
This implies that when using the default event publishing strategy, your listener will not be notified about an entry whose
value is updated from one that matches the predicate to a new value that does not match the predicate.

Since version 3.7, when you configure Hazelcast members with property `hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types` set to `true`,
handling of entry updates conceptually treats value transition as entry, update or exit with regards to the predicate value space.
The following table compares how a listener is notified about an update to a map entry value under the default
backwards-compatible Hazelcast behavior (when property `hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types` is not set or is set
to `false`) versus when set to `true`:

|===

|| Default | `hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types = true`

| When old value matches predicate, new value does not match predicate
| No event is delivered to entry listener
| `REMOVED` event is delivered to entry listener

| When old value matches predicate, new value matches predicate
| `UPDATED` event is delivered to entry listener
| `UPDATED` event is delivered to entry listener

| When old value does not match predicate, new value does not match predicate
| No event is delivered to entry listener
| No event is delivered to entry listener

| When old value does not match predicate, new value matches predicate
| `UPDATED` event is delivered to entry listener
| `ADDED` event is delivered to entry listener  
|===

As an example, let's listen to the changes made on an employee with the surname "Smith". First, let's create the `Employee` class.

Then, let's create a listener with predicate by adding a listener that tracks `ADDED`, `UPDATED` and `REMOVED` entry events with the `surname` predicate.

[[removing-map-entries-in-bulk-with-predicates]]
==== Removing Map Entries in Bulk with Predicates

You can remove all map entries that match your predicate. For this, Hazelcast offers the method `removeAll()`. Its syntax is as follows:

```
void removeAll(Predicate<K, V> predicate);
```

Normally the map entries matching the predicate are found with a full scan of the map. If the entries are indexed, Hazelcast uses the index search to find them. With index, you can expect that finding the entries is faster.


NOTE: When `removeAll()` is called, ALL entries in the caller member's Near Cache are also removed.

[[adding-interceptors]]
==== Adding Interceptors

You can add intercept operations and execute your own business logic synchronously blocking the operations. You can change the returned value from a `get` operation, change the value in `put`, or `cancel` operations by throwing an exception.

Interceptors are different from listeners. With listeners, you take an action after the operation has been completed. Interceptor actions are synchronous and you can alter the behavior of operation, change its values, or totally cancel it.

Map interceptors are chained, so adding the same interceptor multiple times to the same map can result in duplicate effects. This can easily happen when the interceptor is added to the map at member initialization, so that each member adds the same interceptor. When you add the interceptor in this way, be sure to implement the `hashCode()` method to return the same value for every instance of the interceptor. It is not strictly necessary, but it is a good idea to also implement `equals()` as this will ensure that the map interceptor can be removed reliably.

The IMap API has two methods for adding and removing an interceptor to the map: `addInterceptor` and `removeInterceptor`. Please also refer to the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/MapInterceptor.html[`MapInterceptor` interface] to see the methods used to intercept the changes in a map.

The following is an example usage.

[[preventing-out-of-memory-exceptions]]
==== Preventing Out of Memory Exceptions

It is very easy to trigger an out of memory exception (OOME) with query-based map methods, especially with large clusters or heap sizes. For example, on a cluster with five members having 10 GB of data and 25 GB heap size per member, a single call of `IMap.entrySet()` fetches 50 GB of data and crashes the calling instance.

A call of `IMap.values()` may return too much data for a single member. This can also happen with a real query and an unlucky choice of predicates, especially when the parameters are chosen by a user of your application.

To prevent this, you can configure a maximum result size limit for query based operations. This is not a limit like `SELECT * FROM map LIMIT 100`, which you can achieve by a <<filtering-with-paging-predicates, Paging Predicate>>. A maximum result size limit for query based operations is meant to be a last line of defense to prevent your members from retrieving more data than they can handle.

The Hazelcast component which calculates this limit is the `QueryResultSizeLimiter`.

[[setting-query-result-size-limit]]
===== Setting Query Result Size Limit

If the `QueryResultSizeLimiter` is activated, it calculates a result size limit per partition. Each `QueryOperation` runs on all partitions of a member, so it collects result entries as long as the member limit is not exceeded. If that happens, a `QueryResultSizeExceededException` is thrown and propagated to the calling instance.

This feature depends on an equal distribution of the data on the cluster members to calculate the result size limit per member. Therefore, there is a minimum value defined in `QueryResultSizeLimiter.MINIMUM_MAX_RESULT_LIMIT`. Configured values below the minimum will be increased to the minimum.

[[local-pre-check]]
===== Local Pre-check

In addition to the distributed result size check in the `QueryOperations`, there is a local pre-check on the calling instance. If you call the method from a client, the pre-check is executed on the member that invokes the `QueryOperations`.

Since the local pre-check can increase the latency of a `QueryOperation`, you can configure how many local partitions should be considered for the pre-check, or you can deactivate the feature completely.

[[scope-of-result-size-limit]]
===== Scope of Result Size Limit

Besides the designated query operations, there are other operations that use predicates internally. Those method calls will throw the `QueryResultSizeExceededException` as well. Please see the following matrix to see the methods that are covered by the query result size limit.

image::Map-QueryResultSizeLimiterScope.png[Methods Covered by Query Result Size Limit]

[[configuring-query-result-size]]
===== Configuring Query Result Size

The query result size limit is configured via the following system properties.

* `hazelcast.query.result.size.limit`: Result size limit for query operations on maps. This value defines the maximum number of returned elements for a single query result. If a query exceeds this number of elements, a QueryResultSizeExceededException is thrown.
* `hazelcast.query.max.local.partition.limit.for.precheck`: Maximum value of local partitions to trigger local pre-check for TruePredicate query operations on maps.

Please refer to the <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>> to see the full descriptions of these properties and how to set them.

[[queue]]
=== Queue

Hazelcast distributed queue is an implementation of `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`. Being distributed, Hazelcast distributed queue enables all cluster members to interact with it. Using Hazelcast distributed queue, you can add an item in one cluster member and remove it from another one.

[[getting-a-queue-and-putting-items]]
==== Getting a Queue and Putting Items

Use the Hazelcast instance's `getQueue` method to get the queue, then use the queue's `put` method to put items into the queue.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/queue/SampleQueue.java[tag=samplequeue]
----

FIFO ordering will apply to all queue operations across the cluster. The user objects (such as `MyTask` in the example above) that are enqueued or dequeued have to be `Serializable`.

Hazelcast distributed queue performs no batching while iterating over the queue. All items will be copied locally and iteration will occur locally.

Hazelcast distributed queue uses `ItemListener` to listen to the events that occur when items are added to and removed from the queue. Please refer to the <<listening-for-item-events, Listening for Item Events section>> for information on how to create an item listener class and register it.

[[creating-an-example-queue]]
==== Creating an Example Queue

The following example code illustrates a distributed queue that connects a producer and consumer.

[[putting-items-on-the-queue]]
===== Putting Items on the Queue

Let's `put` one integer on the queue every second, 100 integers total.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/queue/ProducerMember.java[tag=producer]
----
 

`Producer` puts a **-1** on the queue to show that the `put`s are finished. 

[[taking-items-off-the-queue]]
===== Taking Items off the Queue

Now, let's create a `Consumer` class to `take` a message from this queue, as shown below.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/queue/ConsumerMember.java[tag=consumer]
----


As seen in the above example code, `Consumer` waits five seconds before it consumes the next message. It stops once it receives **-1**. Also note that `Consumer` puts **-1** back on the queue before the loop is ended. 

When you first start `Producer` and then start `Consumer`, items produced on the queue will be consumed from the same queue.

[[balancing-the-queue-operations]]
===== Balancing the Queue Operations

From the above example code, you can see that an item is produced every second and consumed every five seconds. Therefore, the consumer keeps growing. To balance the produce/consume operation, let's start another consumer. This way, consumption is distributed to these two consumers, as seen in the sample outputs below. 

The second consumer is started. After a while, here is the first consumer output:

```
...
Consumed 13 
Consumed 15
Consumer 17
...
```

Here is the second consumer output:

```
...
Consumed 14 
Consumed 16
Consumer 18
...
```

In the case of a lot of producers and consumers for the queue, using a list of queues may solve the queue bottlenecks. In this case, be aware that the order of the messages sent to different queues is not guaranteed. Since in most cases strict ordering is not important, a list of queues is a good solution.

NOTE: The items are taken from the queue in the same order they were put on the queue. However, if there is more than one consumer, this order is not guaranteed.

[[itemids-when-offering-items]]
===== ItemIDs When Offering Items

Hazelcast gives an `itemId` for each item you offer, which is an incrementing sequence identification for the queue items. You should consider the following to understand the `itemId` assignment behavior:

* When a Hazelcast member has a queue and that queue is configured to have at least one backup, and that member is restarted, the `itemId` assignment resumes from the last known highest `itemId` before the restart; `itemId` assignment does not start from the beginning for the new items.
* When the whole cluster is restarted, the same behavior explained in the above consideration applies if your queue has a persistent data store (`QueueStore`). If the queue has `QueueStore`, the `itemId` for the new items are given, starting from the highest `itemId` found in the IDs returned by the method `loadAllKeys`. If the method `loadAllKeys` does not return anything, the `itemId`s will started from the beginning after a cluster restart.
* The above two considerations mean there will be no duplicated `itemId`s in the memory or in the persistent data store.

[[setting-a-bounded-queue]]
==== Setting a Bounded Queue

A bounded queue is a queue with a limited capacity. When the bounded queue is full, no more items can be put into the queue until some items are taken out.

To turn a Hazelcast distributed queue into a bounded queue, set the capacity limit with the `max-size` property. You can set the `max-size` property in the configuration, as shown below. `max-size` specifies the maximum size of the queue. Once the queue size reaches this value, `put` operations will be blocked until the queue size goes below `max-size`, which happens when a consumer removes items from the queue.

Let's set **10** as the maximum size of our example queue in <<creating-an-example-queue, Creating an Example Queue>>.


```
<hazelcast>
  ...
  <queue name="queue">
    <max-size>10</max-size>
  </queue>
  ...
</hazelcast>
```

When the producer is started, ten items are put into the queue and then the queue will not allow more `put` operations. When the consumer is started, it will remove items from the queue. This means that the producer can `put` more items into the queue until there are ten items in the queue again, at which point the `put` operation again becomes blocked.

In this example code, the producer is five times faster than the consumer. It will effectively always be waiting for the consumer to remove items before it can put more on the queue. For this example code, if maximum throughput is the goal, it would be a good option to start multiple consumers to prevent the queue from filling up.

[[queueing-with-persistent-datastore]]
==== Queueing with Persistent Datastore

Hazelcast allows you to load and store the distributed queue items from/to a persistent datastore using the interface `QueueStore`. If queue store is enabled, each item added to the queue will also be stored at the configured queue store. When the number of items in the queue exceeds the memory limit, the subsequent items are persisted in the queue store, they are not stored in the queue memory.

The `QueueStore` interface enables you to store, load and delete queue items with methods like `store`, `storeAll`, `load` and `delete`. The following example class includes all of the `QueueStore` methods.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/queue/TheQueueStore.java[tag=qs]
----



`Item` must be serializable. The following is an example queue store configuration.


```
<queue-store>
  <class-name>com.hazelcast.QueueStoreImpl</class-name>
  <properties>
    <property name="binary">false</property>
    <property name="memory-limit">1000</property>
    <property name="bulk-load">500</property>
  </properties>
</queue-store>
```

Let's explain the queue store properties.

* **Binary**: By default, Hazelcast stores the queue items in serialized form, and before it inserts the queue items into the queue store, it deserializes them. If you are not reaching the queue store from an external application, you might prefer that the items be inserted in binary form. Do this by setting the `binary` property to true: then you can get rid of the deserialization step, which is a performance optimization. The `binary` property is false by default.
* **Memory Limit**: This is the number of items after which Hazelcast will store items only to the datastore. For example, if the memory limit is 1000, then the 1001st item will be put only to the datastore. This feature is useful when you want to avoid out-of-memory conditions. If you want to always use memory, you can set it to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The default number for `memory-limit` is 1000.
* **Bulk Load**: When the queue is initialized, items are loaded from `QueueStore` in bulks. Bulk load is the size of these bulks. The default value of `bulk-load` is 250.

[[split-brain-protection-for-queue]]
==== Split-Brain Protection for Queue

Queues can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying queue operations (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition. 

Following is a list of methods that now support Split-Brain Protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

* WRITE, READ_WRITE
** `Collection.addAll()`
** `Collection.removeAll()`, `Collection.retainAll()`
** `BlockingQueue.offer()`, `BlockingQueue.add()`, `BlockingQueue.put()`
** `BlockingQueue.drainTo()`
** `IQueue.poll()`, `Queue.remove()`, `IQueue.take()`

Hazelcast distributed queue has one synchronous backup by default. By having this backup, when a cluster member with a queue goes down, another member having the backup of that queue will continue. Therefore, no items are lost. You can define the number of synchronous backups for a queue using the `backup-count` element in the declarative configuration. A queue can also have asynchronous backups: you can define the number of asynchronous backups using the `async-backup-count` element.

To set the maximum size of the queue, use the `max-size` element. To purge unused or empty queues after a period of time, use the `empty-queue-ttl` element. If you define a value (time in seconds) for the `empty-queue-ttl` element, then your queue will be destroyed if it stays empty or unused for the time in seconds that you give.

The following is the full list of queue configuration elements with their descriptions.

* `max-size`: Maximum number of items in the queue. It is used to set an upper bound for the queue. You will not be able to put more items when the queue reaches to this maximum size whether you have a queue store configured or not.
* `backup-count`: Number of synchronous backups. Queue is a non-partitioned data structure, so all entries of a queue reside in one partition. When this parameter is '1', it means there will be one backup of that queue in another member in the cluster. When it is '2', two members will have the backup.
* `async-backup-count`: Number of asynchronous backups.
* `empty-queue-ttl`: Used to purge unused or empty queues. If you define a value (time in seconds) for this element, then your queue will be destroyed if it stays empty or unused for that time.
* `item-listeners`: Adds listeners (listener classes) for the queue items. You can also set the attribute `include-value` to `true` if you want the item event to contain the item values. You can set `local` to `true` if you want to listen to the items on the local member.
* `queue-store`: Includes the queue store factory class name and the properties  *binary*, *memory limit* and *bulk load*. Please refer to <<queueing-with-persistent-datastore, Queueing with Persistent Datastore>>.
* `statistics-enabled`: If set to `true`, you can retrieve statistics for this queue using the method `getLocalQueueStats()`.
* `quorum-ref` : Name of quorum configuration that you want this queue to use.

[[multimap]]
=== MultiMap

Hazelcast `MultiMap` is a specialized map where you can store multiple values under a single key. Just like any other distributed data structure implementation in Hazelcast, `MultiMap` is distributed and thread-safe.

Hazelcast `MultiMap` is not an implementation of `java.util.Map` due to the difference in method signatures. It supports most features of Hazelcast Map except for indexing, predicates and MapLoader/MapStore. Yet, like Hazelcast Map, entries are almost evenly distributed onto all cluster members. When a new member joins the cluster, the same ownership logic used in the distributed map applies.

[[getting-a-multimap-and-putting-an-entry]]
==== Getting a MultiMap and Putting an Entry

The following example creates a MultiMap and puts items into it. Use the HazelcastInstance `getMultiMap` method to get the MultiMap, then use the MultiMap `put` method to put an entry into the MultiMap.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/multimap/SampleMultiMap.java[tag=mm]
----

Now let's print the entries in this MultiMap.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/multimap/PrintMember.java[tag=pm]
----

After you run the first code sample, run the `PrintMember` sample. You will see the key **`a`** has two values, as shown below.

`b -> [3]`

`a -> [2, 1]`

Hazelcast MultiMap uses `EntryListener` to listen to events which occur when entries are added to, updated in or removed from the MultiMap. Please refer to the <<listening-for-multimap-events, Listening for MultiMap Events section>> for information on how to create an entry listener class and register it.

[[configuring-multimap]]
==== Configuring MultiMap

When using MultiMap, the collection type of the values can be either **Set** or **List**. Configure the collection type with the `valueCollectionType` parameter. If you choose `Set`, duplicate and null values are not allowed in your collection and ordering is irrelevant. If you choose `List`, ordering is relevant and your collection can include duplicate and null values.

You can also enable statistics for your MultiMap with the `statisticsEnabled` parameter. If you enable `statisticsEnabled`, statistics can be retrieved with `getLocalMultiMapStats()` method.


NOTE: Currently, eviction is not supported for the MultiMap data structure.


The following are the example MultiMap configurations.

**Declarative:**

```
<multimap name="default">
    <backup-count>0</backup-count>

The following are the configuration elements and their descriptions:

* `backup-count`: Defines the number of synchronous backups. For example, if it is set to 1, backup of a partition will be
placed on one other member. If it is 2, it will be placed on two other members.
* `async-backup-count`: The number of asynchronous backups. Behavior is the same as that of the `backup-count` element.
* `statistics-enabled`: You can retrieve some statistics such as owned entry count, backup entry count, last update time and locked entry count by setting this parameter's value as "true". The method for retrieving the statistics is `getLocalMultiMapStats()`.
* `value-collection-type`: Type of the value collection. It can be `SET` or `LIST`.
* `entry-listeners`: Lets you add listeners (listener classes) for the map entries. You can also set the attribute
include-value to true if you want the item event to contain the entry values. You can set
local to true if you want to listen to the entries on the local member.
* `quorum-ref`: Name of quorum configuration that you want this MultiMap to use. Please see the <<split-brain-protection-for-multimap-and-transactionalmultimap, Split-Brain Protection for MultiMap and TransactionalMultiMap section>>.

The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>.


[[set]]
=== Set

Hazelcast Set is a distributed and concurrent implementation of `java.util.Set`.

* Hazelcast Set does not allow duplicate elements.
* Hazelcast Set does not preserve the order of elements.
* Hazelcast Set is a non-partitioned data structure--all the data that belongs to a set will live on one single partition in that member.
* Hazelcast Set cannot be scaled beyond the capacity of a single machine. Since the whole set lives on a single partition, storing a large amount of data on a single set may cause memory pressure. Therefore, you should use multiple sets to store a large amount of data. This way, all the sets will be spread across the cluster, sharing the load.
* A backup of Hazelcast Set is stored on a partition of another member in the cluster so that data is not lost in the event of a primary member failure.
* All items are copied to the local member and iteration occurs locally.
* The equals method implemented in Hazelcast Set uses a serialized byte version of objects, as opposed to `java.util.HashSet`.

* `async-backup-count`: Count of asynchronous backups.
* `max-size`: The maximum number of entries for this Set. It can be any number between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. Its default value is 0, meaning there is no capacity constraint.
* `item-listeners`: Lets you add listeners (listener classes) for the list items. You can also set the attributes `include-value` to `true` if you want the item event to contain the item values. You can set `local` to `true` if you want to listen to the items on the local member.

Hazelcast List uses `ItemListener` to listen to events that occur when items are added to and removed from the List. Please refer to the <<listening-for-item-events, Listening for Item Events section>> for information on how to create an item listener class and register it.

[[configuring-list]]
==== Configuring List


The following are example list configurations.

**Declarative:**

```
<list name="default">
   <backup-count>1</backup-count>
   <async-backup-count>0</async-backup-count>
   <max-size>10</max-size>
   <item-listeners>
      <item-listener>
          com.hazelcast.examples.ItemListener
      </item-listener>
   </item-listeners>
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
</list>
```

**Programmatic:**

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/list/ListConfiguration.java[tag=lc]
----

   

List configuration has the following elements.


* `statistics-enabled`: True (default) if statistics gathering is enabled on the list, false otherwise.
* `backup-count`: Number of synchronous backups. List is a non-partitioned data structure, so all entries of a List reside in one partition. When this parameter is '1', there will be one backup of that List in another member in the cluster. When it is '2', two members will have the backup.
* `async-backup-count`: Number of asynchronous backups.
* `max-size`: The maximum number of entries for this List.
* `item-listeners`: Lets you add listeners (listener classes) for the list items. You can also set the attribute `include-value` to `true` if you want the item event to contain the item values. You can set the attribute `local` to `true` if you want to listen the items on the local member.
* `quorum-ref`: Name of quorum configuration that you want this List to use. Please see the <<split-brain-protection-for-ilist-and-transactionallist, Split-Brain Protection for IList and TransactionalList section>>.

[[split-brain-protection-for-ilist-and-transactionallist]]
==== Split-Brain Protection for IList and TransactionalList

IList & TransactionalList can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying queue operations (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.

Following is a list of methods that now support Split-Brain Protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

IList:

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `add`
** `addAll`
** `clear`
** `remove`
** `removeAll`
** `set`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `add`
** `contains`
** `containsAll`
** `get`
** `indexOf`
** `isEmpty`
** `iterator`
** `lastIndexOf`
** `listIterator`
** `size`
** `subList`
** `toArray`


TransactionalList:

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `add`
** `remove`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `size`


**Configuring Split-Brain Protection**

Split-Brain protection for IList can be configured programmatically using the method http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/ListConfig.html[`setQuorumName()`], or declaratively using the element `quorum-ref`. Following is an example declarative configuration:

```
<list name="default">
   ...
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
   ...
</list>
```


The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>.

[[ringbuffer]]
=== Ringbuffer

Hazelcast Ringbuffer is a replicated but not partitioned data structure that stores its data in a ring-like structure. You can 
think of it as a circular array with a given capacity. Each Ringbuffer has a tail and a head. The tail is where the items are 
added and the head is where the items are overwritten or expired. You can reach each element in a Ringbuffer using a sequence 
ID, which is mapped to the elements between the head and tail (inclusive) of the Ringbuffer. 

[[getting-a-ringbuffer-and-reading-items]]
==== Getting a Ringbuffer and Reading Items

Reading from Ringbuffer is simple: get the Ringbuffer with the HazelcastInstance `getRingbuffer` method, get its current head with
the `headSequence` method and start reading. Use the method `readOne` to return the item at the 
given sequence; `readOne` blocks if no item is available. To read the next item, increment the sequence by one.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/ringbuffer/SampleRB.java[tag=rb]
----


By exposing the sequence, you can now move the item from the Ringbuffer as long as the item is still available. If the item is not available
any longer, `StaleSequenceException` is thrown.

[[adding-items-to-a-ringbuffer]]
==== Adding Items to a Ringbuffer

Adding an item to a Ringbuffer is also easy with the Ringbuffer `add` method:

[source,java]
----
Ringbuffer<String> ringbuffer = hz.getRingbuffer("SampleRB");
ringbuffer.add("someitem");
----

Use the method `add` to return the sequence of the inserted item; the sequence value will always be unique. You can use this as a 
very cheap way of generating unique IDs if you are already using Ringbuffer.

[[iqueue-vs-ringbuffer]]
==== IQueue vs. Ringbuffer

Hazelcast Ringbuffer can sometimes be a better alternative than an Hazelcast IQueue. Unlike IQueue, Ringbuffer does not remove the items, it only
reads items using a certain position. There are many advantages to this approach:

* The same item can be read multiple times by the same thread. This is useful for realizing semantics of read-at-least-once or 
read-at-most-once.
* The same item can be read by multiple threads. Normally you could use an IQueue per thread for the same semantic, but this is 
less efficient because of the increased remoting. A take from an IQueue is destructive, so the change needs to be applied for backup 
also, which is why a `queue.take()` is more expensive than a `ringBuffer.read(...)`.
* Reads are extremely cheap since there is no change in the Ringbuffer. Therefore no replication is required. 
* Reads and writes can be batched to speed up performance. Batching can dramatically improve the performance of Ringbuffer.
 
[[configuring-ringbuffer-capacity]]
==== Configuring Ringbuffer Capacity

By default, a Ringbuffer is configured with a `capacity` of 10000 items. This creates an array with a size of 10000. If 
a `time-to-live` is configured, then an array of longs is also created that stores the expiration time for every item. 
In a lot of cases you may want to change this `capacity` number to something that better fits your needs. 

Below is a declarative configuration example of a Ringbuffer with a `capacity` of 2000 items.

```
<ringbuffer name="rb">
    <capacity>2000</capacity>
</ringbuffer>
```

Currently, Hazelcast Ringbuffer is not a partitioned data structure; its data is stored in a single partition and the replicas
 are stored in another partition. Therefore, create a Ringbuffer that can safely fit in a single cluster member. 

[[backing-up-ringbuffer]]
==== Backing Up Ringbuffer

Hazelcast Ringbuffer has a single synchronous backup by default. You can control the Ringbuffer backup just like most of the other Hazelcast 
distributed data structures by setting the synchronous and asynchronous backups: `backup-count` and `async-backup-count`. In the example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with no
synchronous backups and one asynchronous backup:

```
<ringbuffer name="rb">
    <backup-count>0</backup-count>
    <async-backup-count>1</async-backup-count>
</ringbuffer>
```

An asynchronous backup will probably give you better performance. However, there is a chance that the item added will be lost 
when the member owning the primary crashes before the backup could complete. You may want to consider batching
methods if you need high performance but do not want to give up on consistency.

[[configuring-ringbuffer-time-to-live]]
==== Configuring Ringbuffer Time-To-Live

You can configure Hazelcast Ringbuffer with a time-to-live in seconds. Using this setting, you can control how long the items remain in 
the Ringbuffer before they are expired. By default, the time-to-live is set to 0, meaning that unless the item is overwritten, 
it will remain in the Ringbuffer indefinitely. If you set a time-to-live and an item is added, then, depending on the Overflow Policy, 
either the oldest item is overwritten, or the call is rejected. 

In the example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with a time-to-live of 180 seconds.

```
<ringbuffer name="rb">
    <time-to-live-seconds>180</time-to-live-seconds>
</ringbuffer>
```

[[setting-ringbuffer-overflow-policy]]
==== Setting Ringbuffer Overflow Policy

Using the overflow policy, you can determine what to do if the oldest item in the Ringbuffer is not old enough to expire when
 more items than the configured Ringbuffer capacity are being added. The below options are currently available.
 
* `OverflowPolicy.OVERWRITE`: The oldest item is overwritten. 
* `OverflowPolicy.FAIL`: The call is aborted. The methods that make use of the OverflowPolicy return `-1` to indicate that adding
the item has failed. 

Overflow policy gives you fine control on what to do if the Ringbuffer is full. You can also use the overflow policy to apply 
a back pressure mechanism. The following example code shows the usage of an exponential backoff.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/ringbuffer/Writer.java[tag=writer]
----


[[ringbuffer-with-persistent-datastore]]
==== Ringbuffer with Persistent Datastore

Hazelcast allows you to load and store the Ringbuffer items from/to a persistent datastore using the interface `RingbufferStore`. If a Ringbuffer store is enabled, each item added to the Ringbuffer will also be stored at the configured Ringbuffer store. 

If the Ringbuffer store is configured, you can get items with sequences which are no longer in the actual Ringbuffer but are only in the Ringbuffer store. This will probably be much slower but still allow you to continue consuming items from the Ringbuffer even if they are overwritten with newer items in the Ringbuffer.

When a Ringbuffer is being instantiated, it will check if the Ringbuffer store is configured and will request the latest sequence in the Ringbuffer store. This is to enable the Ringbuffer to start with sequences larger than the ones in the Ringbuffer store. In this case, the Ringbuffer is empty but you can still request older items from it (which will be loaded from the Ringbuffer store).

The Ringbuffer store will store items in the same format as the Ringbuffer. If the `BINARY` in-memory format is used, the Ringbuffer store must implement the interface `RingbufferStore<byte[]>` meaning that the Ringbuffer will receive items in the binary format. If the `OBJECT` in-memory format is used, the Ringbuffer store must implement the interface `RingbufferStore<K>`, where `K` is the type of item being stored (meaning that the Ringbuffer store will receive the deserialized object).

When adding items to the Ringbuffer, the method `storeAll` allows you to store items in batches.

The following example class includes all of the `RingbufferStore` methods.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/ringbuffer/TheRingbufferObjectStore.java[tag=rbstore]
----


`Item` must be serializable. The following is an example of a Ringbuffer with the Ringbuffer store configured and enabled.


```
    <ringbuffer name="default">
        <capacity>10000</capacity>
        <time-to-live-seconds>30</time-to-live-seconds>
        <backup-count>1</backup-count>
        <async-backup-count>0</async-backup-count>
        <in-memory-format>BINARY</in-memory-format>
        <ringbuffer-store>
            <class-name>com.hazelcast.RingbufferStoreImpl</class-name>
        </ringbuffer-store>
    </ringbuffer>
```

Below are the explanations for the Ringbuffer store configuration elements: 

* `class-name: Name of the class implementing the `RingbufferStore` interface.    
* `factory-class-name`: Name of the class implementing the `RingbufferStoreFactory` interface. This interface allows a factory class to be registered instead of a class implementing the `RingbufferStore` interface.
    
Either the `class-name` or the `factory-class-name` element should be used.

[[configuring-ringbuffer-in-memory-format]]
==== Configuring Ringbuffer In-Memory Format

You can configure Hazelcast Ringbuffer with an in-memory format that controls the format of the Ringbuffer's stored items. By default, `BINARY` in-memory format is used, 
meaning that the object is stored in a serialized form. You can select the `OBJECT` in-memory format, which is useful when filtering is 
applied or when the `OBJECT` in-memory format has a smaller memory footprint than `BINARY`. 

In the declarative configuration example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with the `OBJECT` in-memory format:

```
<ringbuffer name="rb">
    <in-memory-format>OBJECT</in-memory-format>
</ringbuffer>
```

[[configuring-split-brain-protection-for-ringbuffer]]
==== Configuring Split-Brain Protection for Ringbuffer

Ringbuffer can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying Ringbuffer operations. This is a check to avoid performing successful Ringbuffer operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition and can be configured using the element `quorum-ref`. You should set this element's value as the quorum's name, which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>. Following is an example snippet:

```
<ringbuffer name="rb">
    <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
</ringbuffer>
```

Following is a list of methods that now support Split-Brain Protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `add`
** `addAllAsync`
** `addAsync`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `capacity`
** `headSequence`
** `readManyAsync`
** `readOne`
** `remainingCapacity`
** `size`
** `tailSequence`

[[adding-batched-items]]
==== Adding Batched Items

In the previous examples, the method `ringBuffer.add()` is used to add an item to the Ringbuffer. The problems with this method 
are that it always overwrites and that it does not support batching. Batching can have a huge
impact on the performance. You can use the method `addAllAsync` to support batching. 

Please see the following example code.

```
List<String> items = Arrays.asList("1","2","3");
ICompletableFuture<Long> f = rb.addAllAsync(items, OverflowPolicy.OVERWRITE);
f.get();
```  
      
In the above case, three strings are added to the Ringbuffer using the policy `OverflowPolicy.OVERWRITE`. Please see the <<setting-ringbuffer-overflow-policy, Overflow Policy section>> for more information.

[[reading-batched-items]]
==== Reading Batched Items

In the previous example, the `readOne` method read items from the Ringbuffer. `readOne` is simple but not very efficient for the following reasons:

* `readOne` does not use batching.
* `readOne` cannot filter items at the source; the items need to be retrieved before being filtered.

The method `readManyAsync` can read a batch of items and can filter items at the source. 

Please see the following example code.

```
ICompletableFuture<ReadResultSet<E>> readManyAsync(
   long startSequence, 
   int minCount,                                              
   int maxCount, 
   IFunction<E, Boolean> filter);
```

The meanings of the `readManyAsync` arguments are given below.

* `startSequence`: Sequence of the first item to read.
* `minCount`: Minimum number of items to read. If you do not want to block, set it to 0. If you want to block for at least one item,
set it to 1.
* `maxCount`: Maximum number of the items to retrieve. Its value cannot exceed 1000.
* `filter`: A function that accepts an item and checks if it should be returned. If no filtering should be applied, set it to null.

A full example is given below.

```
long sequence = rb.headSequence();
for(;;) {
    ICompletableFuture<ReadResultSet<String>> f = rb.readManyAsync(sequence, 1, 10, null);
    ReadResultSet<String> rs = f.get();
    for (String s : rs) {
        System.out.println(s);
    }
    sequence+=rs.readCount();
}
``` 
       
Please take a careful look at how your sequence is being incremented. You cannot always rely on the number of items being returned
if the items are filtered out.

[[using-async-methods]]
==== Using Async Methods

Hazelcast Ringbuffer provides asynchronous methods for more powerful operations like batched writing or batched reading with filtering. 
To make these methods synchronous, just call the method `get()` on the returned future.

Please see the following example code.

```
ICompletableFuture f = ringbuffer.addAsync(item, OverflowPolicy.FAIL);
f.get();
```

However, you can also use `ICompletableFuture` to get notified when the operation has completed. The advantage of `ICompletableFuture` is that the thread used for the call is not blocked till the response is returned.

Please see the below code as an example of when you want to 
get notified when a batch of reads has completed.

```
ICompletableFuture<ReadResultSet<String>> f = rb.readManyAsync(sequence, min, max, someFilter);
f.andThen(new ExecutionCallback<ReadResultSet<String>>() {
   @Override
   public void onResponse(ReadResultSet<String> response) {
        for (String s : response) {
            System.out.println("Received:" + s);
        }
   }

   @Override
   public void onFailure(Throwable t) {
        t.printStackTrace();
   }
});
```

[[ringbuffer-configuration-examples]]
==== Ringbuffer Configuration Examples

The following shows the declarative configuration of a Ringbuffer called `rb`. The configuration is modeled after the Ringbuffer defaults.

```
<ringbuffer name="rb">
    <capacity>10000</capacity>
    <backup-count>1</backup-count>
    <async-backup-count>0</async-backup-count>
    <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>
    <in-memory-format>BINARY</in-memory-format>
    <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>    
</ringbuffer>
```

You can also configure a Ringbuffer programmatically. The following is a programmatic version of the above declarative configuration.

[source,java]

include::{javasource}/dds/ringbuffer/RBConfiguration.java[tag=rbc]
----

[[topic]]
=== Topic

Hazelcast provides a distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers. This is
also known as a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model. Publishing and subscribing operations are cluster wide.
When a member subscribes to a topic, it is actually registering for messages published by any member in the cluster,
including the new members that joined after you add the listener.

NOTE: Publish operation is async. It does not wait for operations to run in
remote members; it works as fire and forget.

[[getting-a-topic-and-publishing-messages]]
==== Getting a Topic and Publishing Messages

Use the HazelcastInstance's `getTopic` method to get the topic, then use the topic's `publish` method to publish your messages. The following is a sample publisher:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/topic/TopicPublisher.java[tag=tp]
----

And here is a sample subscriber:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/topic/TopicSubscriber.java[tag=tsub]
----


Hazelcast Topic uses the `MessageListener` interface to listen for events that occur when a message is received. Please refer to the <<listening-for-topic-messages, Listening for Topic Messages section>> for information on how to create a message listener class and register it.


[[getting-topic-statistics]]
==== Getting Topic Statistics

Topic has two statistic variables that you can query. These values are incremental and local to the member.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/topic/TopicStats.java[tag=ts]
----


`getPublishOperationCount` and `getReceiveOperationCount` returns the total number of published and received messages since the start of this member, respectively. Please note that these values are not backed up, so if the member goes down, these values will be lost.

You can disable this feature with topic configuration. Please see the <<configuring-topic, Configuring Topic section>>.

NOTE: These statistics values can be also viewed in Management Center. Please see the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#monitoring-topics[Monitoring Topics section] in Hazelcast Management Center Reference Manual.

[[understanding-topic-behavior]]
==== Understanding Topic Behavior

Each cluster member has a list of all registrations in the cluster. When a new member is registered for a topic, it sends a registration message to all members in the cluster. Also, when a new member joins the cluster, it will receive all registrations made so far in the cluster.

The behavior of a topic varies depending on the value of the configuration parameter `globalOrderEnabled`.

[[ordering-messages-as-published]]
===== Ordering Messages as Published

If `globalOrderEnabled` is disabled, messages are not ordered and listeners (subscribers) process the messages in the order that the messages are published. If cluster member M publishes messages *m1, m2, m3, ..., mn* to a topic **T**, then Hazelcast makes sure that all of the subscribers of topic **T** will receive and process *m1, m2, m3, ..., mn* in the given order.

Here is how it works. Let's say that we have three members (*member1*, *member2* and *member3*) and that *member1* and *member2* are registered to a topic named `news`. Note that all three members know that *member1* and *member2* are registered to `news`.
	
In this example, *member1* publishes two messages: `a1` and `a2`. *Member3* publishes two messages: `c1` and `c2`. When *member1* and *member3* publish a message, they will check their local list for registered members, they will discover that *member1* and *member2* are in their lists, and then they will fire messages to those members. One possible order of the messages received could be the following.

*member1* -> `c1`, `a1`, `a2`, `c2`

*member2* -> `c1`, `c2`, `a1`, `a2`

[[ordering-messages-for-members]]
===== Ordering Messages for Members

If `globalOrderEnabled` is enabled, all members listening to the same topic will get its messages in the same order.

Here is how it works. Let's say that we have three members (*member1*, *member2* and *member3*) and that *member1* and *member2* are registered to a topic named `news`. Note that all three members know that *member1* and *member2* are registered to `news`.

In this example, *member1* publishes two messages: `a1` and `a2`. *Member3* publishes two messages: `c1` and `c2`. When a member publishes messages over the topic `news`, it first calculates which partition the `news` ID corresponds to. Then it sends an operation to the owner of the partition for that member to publish messages. Let's assume that `news` corresponds to a partition that *member2* owns. *member1* and *member3* first sends all messages to *member2*. Assume that the messages are published in the following order:

*member1* -> `a1`, `c1`, `a2`, `c2`

*member2* then publishes these messages by looking at registrations in its local list. It sends these messages to *member1* and *member2* (it makes a local dispatch for itself).

*member1* -> `a1`, `c1`, `a2`, `c2`

*member2* -> `a1`, `c1`, `a2`, `c2`

This way we guarantee that all members will see the events in the same order.

[[keeping-generated-and-published-order-the-same]]
===== Keeping Generated and Published Order the Same

In both cases, there is a `StripedExecutor` in EventService that is responsible for dispatching the received message. For all events in Hazelcast, the order that events are generated and the order they are published to the user are guaranteed to be the same via this `StripedExecutor`.

In `StripedExecutor`, there are as many threads as are specified in the property  `hazelcast.event.thread.count` (default is five). For a specific event source (for a particular topic name), *hash of that source's name % 5* gives the ID of the responsible thread. Note that there can be another event source (entry listener of a map, item listener of a collection, etc.) corresponding to the same thread. In order not to make other messages to block, heavy processing should not be done in this thread. If there is time-consuming work that needs to be done, the work should be handed over to another thread. Please see the <<getting-a-topic-and-publishing-messages, Getting a Topic and Publishing Messages section>>.



[[configuring-topic]]
==== Configuring Topic

To configure a topic, set the topic name, decide on statistics and global ordering, and set message listeners.
Default values are:

* `global-ordering` is **false**, meaning that by default, there is no guarantee of global order.
* `statistics` is **true**, meaning that by default, statistics are calculated.

You can see the example configuration snippets below. 

**Declarative:**

```
<hazelcast>
  ...
  <topic name="yourTopicName">
    <global-ordering-enabled>true</global-ordering-enabled>
    <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>
    <message-listeners>
      <message-listener>MessageListenerImpl</message-listener>
    </message-listeners>
  </topic>
  ...
</hazelcast>
```

**Programmatic:**

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/topic/TopicConfiguration.java[tag=tc]
----

Topic configuration has the following elements.

* `statistics-enabled`: Default is `true`, meaning statistics are calculated.
* `global-ordering-enabled`: Default is `false`, meaning there is no global order guarantee.
* `message-listeners`: Lets you add listeners (listener classes) for the topic messages.



Besides the above elements, there are the following system properties that are topic related but not topic specific:

* `hazelcast.event.queue.capacity` with a default value of 1,000,000
* `hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis` with a default value of 250
* `hazelcast.event.thread.count` with a default value of 5

For a description of these parameters, please see the <<global-event-configuration, Global Event Configuration section>>.

[[reliable-topic]]
=== Reliable Topic

Reliable Topic uses the same `ITopic` interface
as a regular topic. The main difference is that Reliable Topic is backed up by the Ringbuffer data structure. The following are the advantages of this approach:

* Events are not lost since the Ringbuffer is configured with one synchronous backup by default.
* Each Reliable `ITopic` gets its own Ringbuffer; if a topic has a very fast producer, it will not lead to problems at topics that run at a slower pace.
* Since the event system behind a regular `ITopic` is shared with other data structures, e.g., collection listeners, 
  you can run into isolation problems. This does not happen with the Reliable `ITopic`.

Here is a sample code snippet for a publisher using Reliable Topic:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/reliabletopic/PublisherMember.java[tag=publisher]
----


And the following is a sample code snippet for the subscriber:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/reliabletopic/SubscribedMember.java[tag=sm]
----

When you create a Reliable Topic, Hazelcast automatically creates a Ringbuffer for it. You may configure this Ringbuffer by adding a Ringbuffer config with the same name as the Reliable Topic. For instance, if you have a Reliable Topic with the name "sometopic", you should add a Ringbuffer config with the name "sometopic" to configure the backing Ringbuffer. Some of the things that you may configure is the capacity, the time-to-live for the topic messages and you can even add a Ringbuffer store which will allow you to have a persistent topic.
By default, a Ringbuffer does not have any TTL (time-to-live) and it has a limited capacity; you may want to change that configuration. The following is an example configuration for the "sometopic" given above.

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>

    <!-- This is the ringbuffer that is used by the 'sometopic' Reliable-topic. As you can see the
         ringbuffer has the same name as the topic. -->
    <ringbuffer name="sometopic">
        <capacity>1000</capacity>
        <time-to-live-seconds>5</time-to-live-seconds>
    </ringbuffer>

    <reliable-topic name="sometopic">
        <topic-overload-policy>BLOCK</topic-overload-policy>
    </reliable-topic>
</hazelcast>
----

Please see the <<configuring-reliable-topic, Configuring Reliable Topic section>> below for the descriptions of all Reliable Topic configuration elements.

By default, the Reliable `ITopic` uses a shared thread pool. If you need a better isolation, you can configure a custom executor on the 
`ReliableTopicConfig`. 

Because the reads on a Ringbuffer are not destructive, batching is easy to apply. `ITopic` uses read batching and reads
ten items at a time (if available) by default. See <<reading-batched-items, Reading Batched Items>> for more information.

[[slow-consumers]]
==== Slow Consumers

The Reliable `ITopic` provides control and a way to deal with slow consumers. It is unwise to keep events for a slow consumer in memory 
indefinitely since you do not know when the slow consumer is going to catch up. You can control the size of the Ringbuffer by using its capacity. For the cases when a Ringbuffer runs out of its capacity, you can specify the following policies for the `TopicOverloadPolicy` configuration:

* `DISCARD_OLDEST`: Overwrite the oldest item, even if a TTL is set. In this case the fast producer supersedes a slow consumer.
* `DISCARD_NEWEST`: Discard the newest item.
* `BLOCK`: Wait until the items are expired in the Ringbuffer.
* `ERROR`: Immediately throw `TopicOverloadException` if there is no space in the Ringbuffer.

[[configuring-reliable-topic]]
==== Configuring Reliable Topic

The following are example Reliable Topic configurations.


**Declarative:**

```
<reliable-topic name="default">
    <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>
    <message-listeners>
        <message-listener>
        ...
        </message-listener>
    </message-listeners>
    <read-batch-size>10</read-batch-size>
    <topic-overload-policy>BLOCK</topic-overload-policy>
</reliable-topic>
```

**Programmatic:**

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
ReliableTopicConfig rtConfig = config.getReliableTopicConfig( "default" );
rtConfig.setTopicOverloadPolicy( TopicOverloadPolicy.BLOCK )
        .setReadBatchSize( 10 )
        .setStatisticsEnabled( true );
----

Reliable Topic configuration has the following elements.

* `statistics-enabled`: Enables or disables the statistics collection for the Reliable Topic. Its default value is `true`.
* `message-listener`: Message listener class that listens to the messages when they are added or removed.
* `read-batch-size`: Minimum number of messages that Reliable Topic will try to read in batches. Its default value is 10.
* `topic-overload-policy`: Policy to handle an overloaded topic. Available values are `DISCARD_OLDEST`, `DISCARD_NEWEST`, `BLOCK` and `ERROR`. Its default value is `BLOCK`. See <<slow-consumers, Slow Consumers>> for definitions of these policies.


[[lock]]
=== Lock

ILock is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`, meaning that if you lock using an ILock, the critical
section that it guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster, provided that there are no network failures. Even though locks are great for synchronization, they can lead to problems if not used properly. Also note that Hazelcast Lock does not support fairness.

[[using-try-catch-blocks-with-locks]]
==== Using Try-Catch Blocks with Locks

Always use locks with *try*-*catch* blocks. This will ensure that locks are released if an exception is thrown from
the code in a critical section. Also note that the `lock` method is outside the *try*-*catch* block because we do not want to unlock
if the lock operation itself fails.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/lock/SampleLock.java[tag=lock]
----

[[releasing-locks-with-trylock-timeout]]
==== Releasing Locks with tryLock Timeout

If a lock is not released in the cluster, another thread that is trying to get the
lock can wait forever. To avoid this, use `tryLock` with a timeout value. You can
set a high value (normally it should not take that long) for `tryLock`. You can check the return value of `tryLock` as follows:

[source,java]
----
if ( lock.tryLock ( 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) ) {
  try {  
    // do some stuff here..  
  } finally {  
    lock.unlock();  
  }   
} else {
  // warning
}
----

[[avoiding-waiting-threads-with-lease-time]]
==== Avoiding Waiting Threads with Lease Time

You can also avoid indefinitely waiting threads by using lock with lease time - the lock will be released in the given lease time. The lock can be safely unlocked before the lease time expires. Note that the unlock operation can
throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if the lock is released because the lease time expires. If that is the case, critical section guarantee is broken.

Please see the below example.

[source,java]
----
lock.lock( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS )
try {
  // do some stuff here..
} finally {
  try {
    lock.unlock();
  } catch ( IllegalMonitorStateException ex ){
    // WARNING Critical section guarantee can be broken
  }
}
----

You can also specify a lease time when trying to acquire a lock: `tryLock(time, unit, leaseTime, leaseUnit)`. In that case, it tries to acquire the lock within the specified lease time. If the lock is not available, the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes until either it acquires the lock or the specified waiting time elapses. Note that this lease time cannot be longer than the time you specify with the system property `hazelcast.lock.max.lease.time.seconds`. Please see the <<system-properties, System Properties appendix>> to see the description of this property and to learn how to set a system property.


[[understanding-lock-behavior]]
==== Understanding Lock Behavior

* Locks are fail-safe. If a member holds a lock and some other members go down, the cluster will keep your locks safe and available.
Moreover, when a member leaves the cluster, all the locks acquired by that dead member will be removed so that those
locks are immediately available for live members.
* Locks are re-entrant. The same thread can lock multiple times on the same lock. Note that for other threads to be able to require this lock, the owner of the lock must call `unlock` as many times as the owner called `lock`.
* In the split-brain scenario, the cluster behaves as if it were two different clusters. Since two separate clusters are not aware of each other,
two members from different clusters can acquire the same lock.
For more information on places where split-brain syndrome can be handled, please see <<split-brain-syndrome, Split-Brain syndrome>>.
* Locks are not automatically removed. If a lock is not used anymore, Hazelcast will not automatically garbage collect the lock. 
This can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError`. If you create locks on the fly, make sure they are destroyed.
* Hazelcast IMap also provides locking support on the entry level with the method `IMap.lock(key)`. Although the same infrastructure 
is used, `IMap.lock(key)` is not an ILock and it is not possible to expose it directly.

[[ilock-vs-imaplock]]
===== ILock vs. IMap.lock

ILock-based locks use system resources even when they are not acquired. You have to call `destroy()`, but this can have a side effect when another thread is trying to acquire it. ILock-based lock is a good choice when you have a limited number of locks. The IMap-based locks are auto-destructed. They use no resources when they are not acquired. This implies they are invisible for monitoring unless they are being hold by some thread.

[[synchronizing-threads-with-icondition]]
==== Synchronizing Threads with ICondition

`ICondition` is the distributed implementation of the `notify`, `notifyAll` and `wait` operations on the Java object. You can use it to synchronize
threads across the cluster. More specifically, you use `ICondition` when a thread's work depends on another thread's output. A good example
is producer/consumer methodology. 

Please see the below code examples for a producer/consumer implementation.

**Producer thread:**

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Lock lock = hazelcastInstance.getLock( "myLockId" );
ICondition condition = lock.newCondition( "myConditionId" );

lock.lock();
try {
  while ( !shouldProduce() ) {
    condition.await(); // frees the lock and waits for signal
                       // when it wakes up it re-acquires the lock
                       // if available or waits for it to become
                       // available
  }
  produce();
  condition.signalAll();
} finally {
  lock.unlock();
}
----

NOTE: The method `await()` takes time value and time unit as arguments. If you specify a negative value for the time, it is interpreted as infinite.

**Consumer thread:**

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Lock lock = hazelcastInstance.getLock( "myLockId" );
ICondition condition = lock.newCondition( "myConditionId" );

lock.lock();
try {
  while ( !canConsume() ) {
    condition.await(); // frees the lock and waits for signal
                       // when it wakes up it re-acquires the lock if 
                       // available or waits for it to become
                       // available
  }
  consume();
  condition.signalAll();
} finally {
  lock.unlock();
}
----

[[split-brain-protection-for-lock]]
==== Split-Brain Protection for Lock

Locks can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying lock operations (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). This is a check to avoid performing successful lock operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition. Due to the implementation details, the check does not guarantee that the lock will fail in all conditions of a network partition and it can happen that two members can acquire the same lock.

Once the membership change has been detected, the lock operations will fail with a `QuorumException` if enough size of members are not present. In essence, this does not provide correctness but rather narrows down the window of opportunity in which locks can continue operations on several members concurrently.

Although the check does not provide correctness it can still be useful. In cases where members acquire the lock to perform some costly but idempotent operation, configuring lock quorum can further prevent some cases where the cluster has been split into several sub-clusters and more than one member perform the same operation.

Following is a list of methods that now support quorum checks. The list is grouped by quorum type. Additionally, since Hazelcast IMap also provides locking support, certain map and multimap methods also allow quorum checks.

* WRITE, READ_WRITE
** `Condition.await(())`, `Condition.awaitUninterruptibly()`, `Condition.awaitNanos()`, `Condition.awaitUntil()`
** `Lock.lockInterruptibly()`, `ILock.lock()`, `IMap.tryLock()`, `IMap.lock()`, `MultiMap.lock()`, `MultiMap.tryLock()`
** `Condition.signal()`, `Condition.signalAll()`
* READ, READ_WRITE
** `ILock.getLockCount()`
** `ILock.getRemainingLeaseTime()`
** `ILock.isLocked()`, `IMap.isLocked()`, `MultiMap.isLocked()`
** `ILock.forceUnlock()`, `IMap.forceUnlock()`, `MultiMap.forceUnlock()`, `ILock.unlock()`, `IMap.unlock()`, `ObjectMultiMapProxy.unlock()`

[[lock-configuration]]
==== Lock Configuration

As mentioned in the <<split-brain-protection-for-lock, Split-brain Protection for Lock section>>, Lock allows for split-brain protection. 

An example of declarative configuration is as follows:

```
<lock name="myLock">
    <quorum-ref>quorum-name</quorum-ref>
</lock>
```

* `quorum-ref` : Name of quorum configuration that you want this lock to use.

An example of programmatic configuration is as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/lock/LockConfiguration.java[tag=lc]
----

NOTE: As mentioned above, a quorum definition for a lock that has the same name or a pattern that matches a map name will force the map locking actions to use the defined quorum. It is important to keep this in mind when using lock quorum and map locking actions.

[[iatomiclong]]
=== IAtomicLong

Hazelcast `IAtomicLong` is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong`. It offers most of AtomicLong's operations such as `get`, `set`, `getAndSet`, `compareAndSet` and `incrementAndGet`. Since IAtomicLong is a distributed implementation, these operations involve remote calls and thus their performances differ from AtomicLong.


The following example code creates an instance, increments it by a million and prints the count.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/iatomiclong/IAtomicLongSample.java[tag=ial]
----

When you start other instances with the code above, you will see the count as *member count* times *a million*.

[[sending-functions-to-iatomiclong]]
==== Sending Functions to IAtomicLong

You can send functions to an IAtomicLong. `IFunction` is a Hazelcast owned, single method interface. The following sample `IFunction` implementation adds two to the original value.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/iatomiclong/IAtomicLongExecuteFuncs.java[tag=add2func]
----

[[executing-functions-on-iatomiclong]]
==== Executing Functions on IAtomicLong

You can use the following methods to execute functions on IAtomicLong.

* `apply`: Applies the function to the value in IAtomicLong without changing the actual value and returning the result.
* `alter`: Alters the value stored in the IAtomicLong by applying the function. It will not send back a result.
* `alterAndGet`: Alters the value stored in the IAtomicLong by applying the function, storing the result in the IAtomicLong and returning the result.
* `getAndAlter`: Alters the value stored in the IAtomicLong by applying the function and returning the original value.

The following sample code includes these methods.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/iatomiclong/IAtomicLongExecuteFuncs.java[tag=ialef]
----


The output of the above class when run is as follows:

```
apply.result: 3
apply.value: 1
alter.value: 3
alterAndGet.result: 3
alterAndGet.value: 3
getAndAlter.result: 1
getAndAlter.value: 3
```

[[reasons-to-use-functions-with-iatomic]]
==== Reasons to Use Functions with IAtomic

The reason for using a function instead of a simple code line like `atomicLong.set(atomicLong.get() + 2));` is that the IAtomicLong read and write operations are not atomic. Since `IAtomicLong` is a distributed implementation, those operations can be remote ones, which may lead to race problems. By using functions, the data is not pulled into the code, but the code is sent to the data. This makes it more scalable.

NOTE: IAtomicLong has one synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. Its backup count is not configurable.

[[split-brain-protection-for-iatomiclong]]
==== Split-Brain Protection for IAtomicLong

IAtomicLong can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying its operations (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). This is a check to avoid performing successful operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.  Following is a list of methods that now support Split-Brain Protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `addAndGet`
** `addAndGetAsync`
** `alter`
** `alterAndGet`
** `alterAndGetAsync`
** `alterAsync`
** `apply`
** `applyAsync`
** `compareAndSet`
** `compareAndSetAsync`
** `decrementAndGet`
** `decrementAndGetAsync`
** `getAndAdd`
** `getAndAddAsync`
** `getAndAlter`
** `getAndAlterAsync`
** `getAndIncrement`
** `getAndIncrementAsync`
** `getAndSet`
** `getAndSetAsync`
** `incrementAndGet`
** `incrementAndGetAsync`
** `set`
** `setAsync`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `get`
** `getAsync`


**Configuring Split-Brain Protection**

Split-Brain protection for IAtomicLong can be configured programmatically using the method http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/AtomicLongConfig.html[`setQuorumName()`], or declaratively using the element `quorum-ref`. Following is an example declarative configuration:

```
<atomic-long name="default">
   ...
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
   ...
</atomic-long>
```

The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>.


[[isemaphore]]
=== ISemaphore

Hazelcast ISemaphore is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`. 

[[controlling-thread-counts-with-permits]]
==== Controlling Thread Counts with Permits

Semaphores offer **permit**s to control the thread counts when performing concurrent activities. To execute a concurrent activity, a thread grants a permit or waits until a permit becomes available. When the execution is completed, the permit is released.

NOTE: ISemaphore with a single permit may be considered as a lock. Unlike the locks, when semaphores are used, any thread can release the permit, and semaphores can have multiple permits.

NOTE: Hazelcast ISemaphore does not support fairness at all times. There are some edge cases where the fairness is not honored, e.g., when the permit becomes available at the time when an internal timeout occurs.

When a permit is acquired on ISemaphore:

* if there are permits, the number of permits in the semaphore is decreased by one and the calling thread performs its activity. If there is contention, the longest waiting thread will acquire the permit before all other threads.
* if no permits are available, the calling thread blocks until a permit becomes available. When a timeout happens during this block, the thread is interrupted.

[[example-semaphore-code]]
==== Example Semaphore Code

The following example code uses an `IAtomicLong` resource 1000 times, increments the resource when a thread starts to use it and decrements it when the thread completes.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/semaphore/SemaphoreMember.java[tag=sm]
----


Let's limit the concurrent access to this resource by allowing at most three threads. You can configure it declaratively by setting the `initial-permits` property, as shown below.

```
<semaphore name="semaphore"> 
  <initial-permits>3</initial-permits>
</semaphore>
```

NOTE: If there is a shortage of permits while the semaphore is being created, value of this property can be set to a negative number.

If you execute the above `SemaphoreMember` class 5 times, the output will be similar to the following:

`At iteration: 0, Active Threads: 1`

`At iteration: 1, Active Threads: 2`

`At iteration: 2, Active Threads: 3`

`At iteration: 3, Active Threads: 3`

`At iteration: 4, Active Threads: 3`

As you can see, the maximum count of concurrent threads is equal or smaller than three. If you remove the semaphore acquire/release statements in `SemaphoreMember`, you will see that there is no limitation on the number of concurrent usages.

Hazelcast also provides backup support for `ISemaphore`. When a member goes down, you can have another member take over the semaphore with the permit information (permits are automatically released when a member goes down). To enable this, configure synchronous or asynchronous backup with the properties `backup-count` and `async-backup-count` (by default, synchronous backup is already enabled).

[[configuring-semaphore]]
==== Configuring Semaphore

The following are example semaphore configurations.

**Declarative:**

```
<semaphore name="semaphore">
   <backup-count>1</backup-count>
   <async-backup-count>0</async-backup-count>
   <initial-permits>3</initial-permits>
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
</semaphore>
```

**Programmatic:**

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/semaphore/SemaphoreMember.java[tag=sc]
----


Semaphore configuration has the below elements.

* `initial-permits`: Thread count to which the concurrent access is limited. For example, if you set it to "3", concurrent access to the object is limited to 3 threads.
* `backup-count`: Number of synchronous backups.
* `async-backup-count`: Number of asynchronous backups.
* `quorum-ref`: Name of quorum configuration that you want this Semaphore to use. Please see the <<split-brain-protection-for-isemaphore, Split-Brain Protection for ISemaphore section>> below.

NOTE: If high performance is more important than not losing the permit information, you can disable the backups by setting `backup-count` to 0.

[[split-brain-protection-for-isemaphore]]
==== Split-Brain Protection for ISemaphore

ISemaphore can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying its operations (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.

** `init`
** `reducePermits`
** `release`
** `tryAcquire`
* READ, READ_WRITE:

Split-Brain protection for ISemaphore can be configured programmatically using the method http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/SemaphoreConfig.html[`setQuorumName()`], or declaratively using the element `quorum-ref`. Following is an example declarative configuration:

```
<semaphore name="default">
   ...
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
   ...
</semaphore>
```

The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>.

[[iatomicreference]]
=== IAtomicReference

The `IAtomicLong` is very useful if you need to deal with a long, but in some cases you need to deal with a reference. That is why Hazelcast also supports the `IAtomicReference` which is the distributed version of the `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference`.

Here is an IAtomicReference example.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/IAtomicReferenceSample.java[tag=iar]
----


When you execute the above example, you will see the following output.

`foo`

[[sending-functions-to-iatomicreference]]
==== Sending Functions to IAtomicReference

Just like `IAtomicLong`, `IAtomicReference` has methods that accept a 'function' as an argument, such as `alter`, `alterAndGet`, `getAndAlter` and `apply`. There are two big advantages of using these methods:

* From a performance point of view, it is better to send the function to the data then the data to the function. Often the function is a lot smaller than the data and therefore cheaper to send over the line. Also the function only needs to be transferred once to the target machine and the data needs to be transferred twice.
* You do not need to deal with concurrency control. If you would perform a load, transform, store, you could run into a data race since another thread might have updated the value you are about to overwrite. 

[[using-iatomicreference]]
==== Using IAtomicReference

Below are some considerations you need to know when you use IAtomicReference.

* `IAtomicReference` works based on the byte-content and not on the object-reference. If you use the `compareAndSet` method, do not change to original value because its serialized content will then be different. It is also important to know that if you rely on Java serialization, sometimes (especially with hashmaps) the same object can result in different binary content.
* `IAtomicReference` will always have one synchronous backup.
* All methods returning an object will return a private copy. You can modify the private copy, but the rest of the world will be shielded from your changes. If you want these changes to be visible to the rest of the world, you need to write the change back to the `IAtomicReference`; but be careful about introducing a data-race. 
* The 'in-memory format' of an `IAtomicReference` is `binary`. The receiving side does not need to have the class definition available unless it needs to be deserialized on the other side, e.g., because a method like 'alter' is executed. This deserialization is done for every call that needs to have the object instead of the binary content, so be careful with expensive object graphs that need to be deserialized.
* If you have an object with many fields or an object graph and you only need to calculate some information or need a subset of fields, you can use the `apply` method. With the `apply` method, the whole object does not need to be sent over the line; only the information that is relevant is sent.

[[split-brain-protection-for-iatomicreference]]
==== Split-Brain Protection for IAtomicReference

IAtomicReference can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying its operations (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). This is a check to avoid performing successful operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.

Following is a list of methods that now support Split-Brain Protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

Following is an example declarative configuration:

```
<atomic-reference name="default">
   ...
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>

```

The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>.

[[icountdownlatch]]
=== ICountDownLatch

Hazelcast `ICountDownLatch` is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch`.

[[gate-keeping-concurrent-activities]]
==== Gate-Keeping Concurrent Activities

`CountDownLatch` is considered to be a gate keeper for concurrent activities. It enables the threads to wait for other threads to complete their operations.

The following code samples describe the mechanism of `ICountDownLatch`. Assume that there is a leader process and there are follower processes that will wait until the leader completes. Here is the leader:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/countdownlatch/Leader.java[tag=leader]
----

Since only a single step is needed to be completed as a sample, the above code initializes the latch with 1. Then, the code sleeps for a while to simulate a process and starts the countdown. Finally, it clears up the latch. Let's write a follower:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/countdownlatch/Follower.java[tag=follower]
----


The follower class above first retrieves `ICountDownLatch` and then calls the `await` method to enable the thread to listen for the latch. The method `await` has a timeout value as a parameter. This is useful when the `countDown` method fails. To see `ICountDownLatch` in action, start the leader first and then start one or more followers. You will see that the followers will wait until the leader completes.

[[recovering-from-failure]]
==== Recovering From Failure

In a distributed environment, the counting down cluster member may go down. In this case, all listeners are notified immediately and automatically by Hazelcast. The state of the current process just before the failure should be verified and 'how to continue now' should be decided, e.g., restart all process operations, continue with the first failed process operation and throw an exception.

[[using-icountdownlatch]]
==== Using ICountDownLatch

Although the `ICountDownLatch` is a very useful synchronization aid, you will probably not use it on a daily basis. Unlike Java's implementation, Hazelcast's `ICountDownLatch` count can be reset after a countdown has finished, but not during an active count.

NOTE: ICountDownLatch has 1 synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. Its backup count is not configurable. Also, the count cannot be re-set during an active count, it should be re-set after the countdown is finished.

[[split-brain-protection-for-icountdownlatch]]
==== Split-Brain Protection for ICountDownLatch

ICountDownLatch can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying ICountDownLatch operations (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.

Following is a list of methods that now support Split-Brain Protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `countDown`
** `trySetCount`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `await`
** `getCount`


**Configuring Split-Brain Protection**

Split-Brain protection for ICountDownLatch can be configured programmatically using the method http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/CountDownLatchConfig.html[`setQuorumName()`], or declaratively using the element `quorum-ref`. Following is an example declarative configuration:

```
<count-down-latch name="default">
   ...
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
   ...
</count-down-latch>
```

The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>.

[[pn-counter]]
=== PN Counter

A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a distributed data structure that achieves high availability by relaxing consistency constraints. There may be several replicas for the same data and these replicas can be modified concurrently without coordination. This means that you may achieve high throughput and low latency when updating a CRDT data structure. On the other hand, all of the updates are replicated asynchronously. Each replica will then receive updates made on other replicas eventually and if no new updates are done, all replicas which can communicate to each other will return the same state (converge) after some time. 
 
Hazelcast offers a lightweight CRDT PN counter (Positive-Negative Counter) implementation where each Hazelcast instance can increment and decrement the counter value and these updates are propagated to all replicas. Only a Hazelcast member can store state for a counter which means that counter method invocations performed on a Hazelcast member are usually local (depending on the configured replica count). If there is no member failure, it is guaranteed that each replica sees the final value of the counter eventually. Counter's state converges with each update and all CRDT replicas that can communicate to each other will eventually have the same state. 

Using the PN Counter, you can get a distributed counter, increment and decrement it, and query its value with RYW (read-your-writes) and monotonic reads. The implementation borrows most methods from the `AtomicLong` which should be familiar in most cases and easily interchangeable in the existing code.

Some examples of PN counter are:

* counting the number of "likes" or "+1"
* counting the number of logged in users
* counting the number of page hits/views

**How it works**

The counter supports adding and subtracting values as well as retrieving the current counter value. Each replica of this counter can perform operations locally without coordination with the other replicas, thus increasing availability. The counter guarantees that whenever two members have received the same set of updates, possibly in a different order, their state is identical, and any conflicting updates are merged automatically. If no new updates are made to the shared state, all members that can communicate will eventually have the same data.

The updates to the counter are applied locally when invoked on a CRDT replica. A CRDT replica can be any Hazelcast instance **which is NOT a client or a lite member**. You can configure the number of replicas in the cluster using the `replica-count` configuration element.
 
When invoking updates from a non-replica instance, the invocation is remote. This may lead to indeterminate state - the update may be applied but the response has not been received. In this case, the caller will be notified with a `TargetDisconnectedException` when invoked from a client or a `MemberLeftException` when invoked from a member.
 
The read and write methods provide monotonic read and RYW (read-your-write) guarantees. These guarantees are session guarantees which means that if no replica with the previously observed state is reachable, the session guarantees are lost and the method invocation will throw a `ConsistencyLostException`. This does not mean that an update is lost. All of the updates are part of some replica and will be eventually reflected in the state of all other replicas. This exception just means that you cannot observe your own writes because all replicas that contain your updates are currently unreachable. After you have received a `ConsistencyLostException`, you can either wait for a sufficiently up-to-date replica to become reachable in which case the session can be continued or you can reset the session by calling the method `reset(). If you have called this method, a new session is started with the next invocation to a CRDT replica.

NOTE: The CRDT state is kept entirely on non-lite (data) members. If there aren't any and the methods here are invoked on a lite member, they fail with a `NoDataMemberInClusterException`.


The following is an example code.

[source,java]

include::{javasource}/dds/PNCounterSample.java[tag=pnc]

This code snippet creates an instance of a PN counter, increments it by 5 and retrieves the value.

[[configuring-pn-counter]]
==== Configuring PN Counter

Following is an example declarative configuration snippet:

```
<hazelcast>
  <pn-counter name="default">
    <replica-count>10</replica-count>
    <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>
  </pn-counter>
</hazelcast>
```

* `name`: Name of your PN Counter.
* `replica-count`: Number of replicas on which state for this PN counter will be kept. This number applies in quiescent state, if there are currently membership changes or clusters are merging, the state may be temporarily kept on more replicas. Its default value is Integer.MAX_VALUE. Generally, keeping the state on more replicas means that more Hazelcast members will be able to perform updates locally but it also means that the PN counter state will be kept on more replicas, increasing the network traffic, decreasing the speed at which replica states converge and increasing the size of the PN counter state kept on each replica.
* `statistics-enabled`: Specifies whether the statistics gathering will be enabled for your PN Counter. If set to `false`, you cannot collect statistics in your implementation and also Hazelcast Management Center will not show them. Its default value is `true`.

Following is an equivalent snippet of Java configuration:

[[configuring-the-crdt-replication-mechanism]]
==== Configuring the CRDT replication mechanism

NOTE: Configuring the replication mechanism is for advanced use cases only - usually the default configuration will work fine for most cases.

In some cases, you may want to configure the replication mechanism for all CRDT implementations. The CRDT states are replicated in rounds (the period is configurable) and in each round the state is replicated up to the configured number of members. Generally speaking, you may increase the speed at which replicas converge at the expense of more network traffic or decrease the network traffic at the expense of slower convergence of replicas. 
Hazelcast implements the state-based replication mechanism - the CRDT state for changed CRDTs is replicated in its entirety to other replicas on each replication round.  

```
<hazelcast>
  <crdt-replication>
      <max-concurrent-replication-targets>1</max-concurrent-replication-targets>
      <replication-period-millis>1000</replication-period-millis>
  </crdt-replication>
</hazelcast>
```

* `max-concurrent-replication-targets`: The maximum number of target members that we replicate the CRDT states to in one period. A higher count will lead to states being disseminated more rapidly at the expense of burst-like behavior - one update to a CRDT will lead to a sudden burst in the number of replication messages in a short time interval. Its default value is 1 which means that each replica will replicate state to only one other replica in each replication round. 
* `replication-period-millis`: The period between two replications of CRDT states in milliseconds. A lower value will increase the speed at which changes are disseminated to other cluster members at the expense of burst-like behavior - less updates will be batched together in one replication message and one update to a CRDT may cause a sudden burst of replication messages in a short time interval. The value must be a positive non-null integer. Its default value is 1000 milliseconds which means that the changed CRDT state is replicated every 1 second. 
     
Following is an equivalent snippet of Java configuration:

[[idgenerator]]
=== IdGenerator

Hazelcast IdGenerator is used to generate cluster-wide unique identifiers. Generated identifiers are long type primitive values between 0 and `Long.MAX_VALUE`.

NOTE: ***Feature is deprecated.*** The implementation can produce duplicate IDs in case of a network split, even with split-brain protection enabled (during short window while split-brain is detected). Please use <<flakeidgenerator, FlakeIdGenerator>> for an alternative implementation which does not suffer from the issue. Also see the <<migrating-to-flakeidgenerator, Migration guide>> at the end of this section.

[[generating-cluster-wide-ids]]
==== Generating Cluster-Wide IDs

ID generation occurs almost at the speed of `AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()`. A group of 10,000 identifiers is allocated for each cluster member. In the background, this allocation takes place with an `IAtomicLong` incremented by 10,000. Once a cluster member generates IDs (allocation is done), `IdGenerator` increments a local counter. If a cluster member uses all IDs in the group, it will get another 10,000 IDs. This way, only one time of network traffic is needed, meaning that 9,999 identifiers are generated in memory instead of over the network. This is fast.

Let's write a sample identifier generator.


[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/IdGeneratorSample.java[tag=idg]
----



Let's run the above code two times. The output will be similar to the following.

```
Members [1] {
  Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 this
}
Id: 1
Id: 2
Id: 3
```


```
Members [2] {
  Member [127.0.0.1]:5701
  Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 this
}
Id: 10001
Id: 10002
Id: 10003
```

[[unique-ids-and-duplicate-ids]]
==== Unique IDs and Duplicate IDs

You can see that the generated IDs are unique and counting upwards. If you see duplicated identifiers, it means your instances could not form a cluster. 


NOTE: Generated IDs are unique during the life cycle of the cluster. If the entire cluster is restarted, IDs start from 0, again or you can initialize to a value using the `init()` method of IdGenerator.

NOTE: IdGenerator has one synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. Its backup count is not configurable.

[[migrating-to-flakeidgenerator]]
==== Migrating to FlakeIdGenerator

The Flake ID generator provides similar features with more safety guarantees during network splits. The two generators are completely different implementations, but both types of generator generate roughly ordered IDs. So in order to ensure uniqueness of the generated IDs, we can force the Flake ID generator to start at least where the old generator ended. This is likely the case, because the values from Flake generator are quite large compared to values from the old generator. Anyway, here are the steps you need to take: 

* Make sure the version of your Hazelcast cluster and of all clients is at least 3.10.
* If the current ID from old `IdGenerator` is higher than the ID from `FlakeIdGenerator`, you need to configure ID offset. See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/blob/master/distributed-primitives/flake-id-generator/src/main/java/FlakeIdMigrationSample.java[FlakeIdMigrationSample] for mor details.
* Replace all calls to `HazelcastInstance.getIdGenerator()` with `HazelcastInstance.getFlakeIdGenerator()`. If you use Spring configuration, replace `<id-generator>` with `<flake-id-generator>`

[[flakeidgenerator]]
=== FlakeIdGenerator

Hazelcast Flake ID Generator is used to generate cluster-wide unique identifiers. Generated identifiers are `long` primitive values and are k-ordered (roughly ordered). IDs are in the range from 0 to Long.MAX_VALUE.

[[generating-cluster-wide-flake-ids]]
==== Generating Cluster-Wide IDs

The IDs contain timestamp component and a node ID component, which is assigned when the member joins the cluster. This allows the IDs to be ordered and unique without any coordination between the members, which makes the generator safe even in split-brain scenarios (for limitations in this case, please see the <<node-id-assignment, Node ID assignment section>> below).

Timestamp component is in milliseconds since 1.1.2018, 0:00 UTC and has 41 bits. This caps the useful lifespan of the generator to little less than 70 years (until ~2088). The sequence component is 6 bits. If more than 64 IDs are requested in single millisecond, IDs will gracefully overflow to the next millisecond and uniqueness is guaranteed in this case. The implementation does not allow overflowing by more than 15 seconds, if IDs are requested at higher rate, the call will block. Note, however, that clients are able to generate even faster because each call goes to a different (random) member and the 64 IDs/ms limit is for single member.

[[flakeidgenerator-performance]]
==== Performance

Operation on member is always local, if the member has valid node ID, otherwise it's remote. On client, the newId() method goes to a random member and gets a batch of IDs, which will then be returned locally for limited time. The pre-fetch size and the validity time can be configured for each client and member.

[[flakeidgenerator-example]]
==== Example

Let's write a sample identifier generator.

[source,java]
----
public class FlakeIdGeneratorSample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HazelcastInstance hazelcast = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();

        ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig()
                .addFlakeIdGeneratorConfig(new FlakeIdGeneratorConfig("idGenerator")
                        .setPrefetchCount(10));
        HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig);

        FlakeIdGenerator idGenerator = client.getFlakeIdGenerator("idGenerator");
        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            sleepSeconds(1);
            System.out.printf("Id: %s\n", idGenerator.newId());
        }
    }
}
----

[[node-id-assignment]]
==== Node ID Assignment

Flake IDs require a unique node ID to be assigned to each member, from which point the member can generate unique IDs without any coordination. Hazelcast uses the member list version from the moment when the member joined the cluster as a unique node ID.

The join algorithm is specifically designed to ensure that member list join version is unique for each member in the cluster. This ensures that IDs are unique even during network splits, with one caveat: at most one member is allowed to join the cluster during a network split. If two members join different subclusters, they are likely to get the same node ID. This will be resolved when the cluster heals, but until then, they can generate duplicate IDs.

[[node-id-overflow]]
===== Node ID Overflow

Node ID component of the ID has 16 bits. Members with the member list join version higher than 2^16 won't be able to generate IDs, but functionality will be preserved by forwarding to another member. It is possible to generate IDs on any member or client as long as there is at least one member with join version smaller than 2^16 in the cluster. The remedy is to restart the cluster: the node ID component will be reset and assigned starting from zero again. Uniqueness after the restart will be preserved thanks to the timestamp component.

[[replicated-map]]
=== Replicated Map

A Replicated Map is a distributed key-value data structure where the data is replicated to all members in the cluster. It provides full replication of entries to all members for high speed access. The following are its features:

* When you have a Replicated Map in the  cluster, your clients can communicate with any cluster member.
* All cluster members are able to perform write operations.
* It supports all methods of the interface `java.util.Map`.
* It supports automatic initial fill up when a new member is started.
* It provides statistics for entry access, write and update so that you can monitor it using Hazelcast Management Center.
* New members joining to the cluster pull all the data from the existing members.
* You can listen to entry events using listeners. Please refer to <<using-entrylistener-on-replicated-map, Using EntryListener on Replicated Map>>. 

[[replicating-instead-of-partitioning]]
==== Replicating Instead of Partitioning

A Replicated Map does not partition data
(it does not spread data to different cluster members); instead, it replicates the data to all members. All other data structures are partitioned in design. 

Replication leads to higher memory consumption. However, a Replicated Map has faster read and write access since the data is available on all members.

Writes could take place on local/remote members in order to provide write-order, eventually being replicated to all other members.

Replicated Map is suitable for objects, catalog data, or idempotent calculable data (such as HTML pages). It fully implements the `java.util.Map` interface, but it lacks the methods from `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` since
there are no atomic guarantees to writes or reads.

NOTE: If Replicated Map is used from a dummy client and this dummy client is connected to a lite member, the entry listeners cannot be registered/de-registered.

NOTE: You cannot use Replicated Map from a lite member. A `com.hazelcast.replicatedmap.ReplicatedMapCantBeCreatedOnLiteMemberException` is thrown if `com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance.getReplicatedMap(name)` is invoked on a lite member.

[[example-replicated-map-code]]
==== Example Replicated Map Code

Here is an example of Replicated Map code. The HazelcastInstance's `getReplicatedMap` method gets the Replicated Map, and the Replicated Map's `put` method creates map entries.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/replicatedmap/FillMapMember.java[tag=fmm]
----


`HazelcastInstance.getReplicatedMap()` returns `com.hazelcast.core.ReplicatedMap` which, as stated above, extends the
`java.util.Map` interface.

The `com.hazelcast.core.ReplicatedMap` interface has some additional methods for registering entry listeners or retrieving values in an expected order.

[[considerations-for-replicated-map]]
==== Considerations for Replicated Map

If you have a large cluster or very high occurrences of updates, the Replicated Map may not scale linearly as expected since it has to replicate update operations to all members in the cluster.

Since the replication of updates is performed in an asynchronous manner, we recommend you enable back pressure in case your system has high occurrences of updates. Please refer to the <<back-pressure, Back Pressure>> section to learn how to enable it.

Replicated Map has an anti-entropy system that will converge values to a common one if some of the members are missing replication updates.

Replicated Map does not guarantee eventual consistency because there are some edge cases that fail to provide consistency.

Replicated Map uses the internal partition system of Hazelcast in order to serialize updates happening on the same key at the same time. This happens by sending updates of the same key to the same Hazelcast member in the cluster.

Due to the asynchronous nature of replication, a Hazelcast member could die before successfully replicating a "write" operation to other members after sending the "write completed" response to its caller during the write process. In this scenario, Hazelcast's internal partition system will promote one of the replicas of the partition as the primary one. The new primary partition will not have the latest "write" since the dead member could not successfully replicate the update. (This will leave the system in a state that the caller is the only one that has the update and the rest of the cluster have not.) In this case even the anti-entropy system simply could not converge the value since the source of true information is lost for the update. This leads to a break in the eventual consistency because different values can be read from the system for the same key.

Other than the aforementioned scenario, the Replicated Map will behave like an eventually consistent system with read-your-writes and monotonic-reads consistency.

[[configuration-design-for-replicated-map]]
==== Configuration Design for Replicated Map

There are several technical design decisions you should consider when you configure a Replicated Map.

**Initial Provisioning**

If a new member joins the cluster, there are two ways you can handle the initial provisioning that is executed to replicate all existing
values to the new member. Each involves how you configure the async fill up.

First, you can configure async fill up to true, which does not block reads while the fill up operation is underway. That way,
you have immediate access on the new member, but it will take time until all the values are eventually accessible. Not yet
replicated values are returned as non-existing (null).

Second, you can configure for a synchronous initial fill up (by configuring the async fill up to false), which blocks every read or write access to the map until the
fill up operation is finished. Use this with caution since it might block your application from operating.

[[configuring-replicated-map]]
==== Configuring Replicated Map

Replicated Map can be configured programmatically or declaratively.

**Declarative Configuration:**

You can declare your Replicated Map configuration in the Hazelcast configuration file `hazelcast.xml`. Please see the following example.

```
<replicatedmap name="default">
  <in-memory-format>BINARY</in-memory-format>
  <async-fillup>true</async-fillup>
  <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>
  <entry-listeners>
    <entry-listener include-value="true">
      com.hazelcast.examples.EntryListener
    </entry-listener>
  </entry-listeners>
  <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
</replicatedmap>
```

* `in-memory-format`: Internal storage format.  Please see the <<in-memory-format-on-replicated-map, In-Memory Format section>>. Its default value is `OBJECT`.
* `async-fillup`: Specifies whether the Replicated Map is available for reads before the initial replication is completed. Its default value is `true`. If set to `false` (i.e., synchronous initial fill up), no exception will be thrown when the Replicated Map is not yet ready, but `null` values can be seen until the initial replication is completed.
* `statistics-enabled`: If set to `true`, the statistics such as cache hits and misses are collected. Its default value is `true`.
* `entry-listener`: Full canonical classname of the `EntryListener` implementation.
** `entry-listener#include-value`: Specifies whether the event includes the value or not. Sometimes the key is enough to react on an event. In those situations, setting this value to `false` will save a deserialization cycle. Its default value is `true`.
** `entry-listener#local`: Not used for Replicated Map since listeners are always local.
* `quorum-ref`: Name of quorum configuration that you want this Replicated Map to use. Please see the <<split-brain-protection-for-replicated-map, Split-Brain Protection for Replicated Map section>>.


**Programmatic Configuration:**

You can configure a Replicated Map programmatically, as you can do for all other data structures in Hazelcast. You must create the configuration upfront, when you instantiate the `HazelcastInstance`.
A basic example of how to configure the Replicated Map using the programmatic approach is shown in the following snippet.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/replicatedmap/ReplicatedMapConfiguration.java[tag=rmc]
----


All properties that can be configured using the declarative configuration are also available using programmatic configuration
by transforming the tag names into getter or setter names.

[[in-memory-format-on-replicated-map]]
===== In-Memory Format on Replicated Map

Currently, two `in-memory-format` values are usable with the Replicated Map.

* `OBJECT` (default): The data will be stored in deserialized form. This configuration is the default choice since
the data replication is mostly used for high speed access. Please be aware that changing the values without a `Map.put()` is
not reflected on the other members but is visible on the changing members for later value accesses.
* `BINARY`: The data is stored in serialized binary format and has to be deserialized on every request. This
option offers higher encapsulation since changes to values are always discarded as long as the newly changed object is
not explicitly `Map.put()` into the map again.

[[using-entrylistener-on-replicated-map]]
==== Using EntryListener on Replicated Map

A `com.hazelcast.core.EntryListener` used on a Replicated Map serves the same purpose as it would on other
data structures in Hazelcast. You can use it to react on add, update and remove operations. Replicated Maps do not yet support eviction.

[[difference-in-entrylistener-on-replicated-map]]
===== Difference in EntryListener on Replicated Map

The fundamental difference in Replicated Map behavior, compared to the other data structures, is that an EntryListener only reflects
changes on local data. Since replication is asynchronous, all listener events are fired only when an operation is finished
on a local member. Events can fire at different times on different members.

[[example-of-replicated-map-entrylistener]]
===== Example of Replicated Map EntryListener

Here is a code example for using EntryListener on a Replicated Map.

The `HazelcastInstance`'s `getReplicatedMap` method gets a Replicated Map (customers), and the `ReplicatedMap`'s `addEntryListener` method adds an entry listener to the Replicated Map. Then, the `ReplicatedMap`'s `put` method adds a Replicated Map
entry and updates it. The method `remove` removes the entry.

[[split-brain-protection-for-replicated-map]]
==== Split-Brain Protection for Replicated Map

Replicated Map can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying its operations (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.

Following is a list of methods that now support Split-Brain Protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `clear`
** `put`
** `putAll`
** `remove`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `containsKey`
** `containsValue`
** `entrySet`
** `get`
** `isEmpty`
** `keySet`
** `size`
** `values`


**Configuring Split-Brain Protection**

Split-Brain protection for Replicated Map can be configured programmatically using the method http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/ReplicatedMapConfig.html[`setQuorumName()`], or declaratively using the element `quorum-ref`. Following is an example declarative configuration:

```
<replicatedmap name="default">
   ...
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
   ...
</replicatedmap>
```

The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>.

[[cardinality-estimator]]
=== Cardinality Estimator Service

Hazelcast's cardinality estimator service is a data structure which implements Flajolet's HyperLogLog algorithm for estimating cardinalities of unique objects in theoretically huge data sets.
The implementation offered by Hazelcast includes improvements from Google's version of the algorithm, i.e., HyperLogLog++.

The cardinality estimator service does not provide any ways to configure its properties, but rather uses some well tested defaults.

* `P`: Precision - 14, using the 14 LSB of the hash for the index.
* `M`: 2 ^ P = 16384 (16K) registers
* `P'`: Sparse Precision - 25
* `Durability`: How many backups for each estimator, default 2

NOTE: It is important to understand that this data structure is not 100% accurate, it is used to provide estimates. The error rate is typically a result of `1.04/sqrt(M)` which in our implementation is around 0.81% for high percentiles.

The memory consumption of this data structure is close to 16K despite the size of elements in the source data set or stream.

There are two phases in using the cardinality estimator.

. Add objects to the instance of the estimator, e.g., for IPs `estimator.add("0.0.0.0.")`. The provided object is first serialized and then the byte array is used to generate a hash for that object.
+
NOTE: Objects must be serializable in a form that Hazelcast understands.
+
. Compute the estimate of the set so far `estimator.estimate()`.

Please see the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/cardinality/CardinalityEstimator.html[cardinality estimator Javadoc] for more information on its API.

The following is an example code.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/CardinalityEstimatorSample.java[tag=ces]

[[split-brain-protection-for-cardinality-estimator]]
==== Split-Brain Protection for Cardinality Estimator

Cardinality Estimator can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying its operations (see <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection>>). This is a check to avoid performing successful queue operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition.

Following is a list of methods that now support Split-Brain Protection checks. The list is grouped by quorum type.

* WRITE, READ_WRITE:
** `add`
** `addAsync`
* READ, READ_WRITE:
** `estimate`
** `estimateAsync`

**Configuring Split-Brain Protection**

Split-Brain protection for Cardinality Estimator can be configured programmatically using the method http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/CardinalityEstimatorConfig.html[`setQuorumName()`], or declaratively using the element `quorum-ref`. Following is an example declarative configuration:

```
<cardinality-estimator name="default">
   ...
   <quorum-ref>quorumname</quorum-ref>
   ...
</cardinality-estimator>
```

The value of `quorum-ref` should be the quorum configuration name which you configured under the `quorum` element as explained in the <<split-brain-protection, Split-Brain Protection section>>.


**Configuring Merge Policy**

While recovering from a Split-Brain syndrome, Cardinality Estimator in the small cluster merges into the bigger cluster based on a configured merge policy. When an estimator merges into the cluster, an estimator with the same name might already exist in the cluster.
So the merge policy resolves these kinds of conflicts with different out-of-the-box strategies. It can be configured programmatically using the method http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/CardinalityEstimatorConfig.html[`setMergePolicyConfig()`], or declaratively using the element `merge-policy`. Following is an example declarative configuration:

```
<cardinality-estimator name="default">
   ...
   <merge-policy>HyperLogLogMergePolicy</merge-policy>
   ...
</cardinality-estimator>
```

Following out-of-the-box merge policies are available:

* `DiscardMergePolicy`: Estimator from the smaller cluster will be discarded.
* `HyperLogLogMergePolicy`: Estimator will merge with the existing one, using the algorithmic merge for HyperLogLog. This is the default policy.
* `PassThroughMergePolicy`: Estimator from the smaller cluster wins.
* `PutIfAbsentMergePolicy`: Estimator from the smaller cluster wins if it doesn't exist in the cluster.

[[event-journal]]
=== Event Journal

The event journal is a distributed data structure that stores the history of mutation actions on map or cache. Each action on the map or cache which modifies its contents (such as `put`, `remove` or scheduled tasks which are not triggered by using the public API) will create an event which will be stored in the event journal. The event will store the event type as well as the key, old value and updated value for the entry (when applicable). As a user, you can only append to the journal indirectly by using the map and cache methods or by configuring expiration and eviction.  By reading from the event journal you can recreate the state of the map or cache at any point in time. 

NOTE: Currently the event journal does not expose a public API for reading the event journal in Hazelcast IMDG. The event journal can be used to stream event data to Hazelcast Jet, so it should be used in conjunction with http://jet.hazelcast.org/[Hazelcast Jet]. Because of this we will describe how to configure it but not how to use it from IMDG. If you enable and configure the event journal, you may only reach it through private API and you will most probably not get any benefits but the journal will retain events nevertheless and consume heap space.

The event journal has a fixed capacity and an expiration time. Internally it is structured as a ringbuffer (partitioned by ringbuffer item) and shares many similarities with it.

[[interaction-with-evictions-and-expiration-for-imap]]
==== Interaction with Evictions and Expiration for IMap
 
Configuring IMap with eviction and expiration can cause the event journal to contain different events on the different replicas of the same partition. You can run into issues if you are reading from the event journal and the partition owner is terminated. A backup replica will then be promoted into the partition owner but the event journal will contain different events. The event count should stay the same but the entries which you previously thought were evicted and expired could now be "alive" and vice versa.

This is because eviction and expiration randomly choose entries to be evicted/expired. The entry is not coordinated between partition replicas. In these cases, the event journal diverges and will not converge at any future point but will remain inconsistent just as well as the contents of the internal record stores are inconsistent between replicas. You may say that the event journal on a specific replica is in-sync with the record store on that replica but the event journals and record stores between replicas are out-of-sync. 

[[configuring-event-journal-capacity]]
==== Configuring Event Journal Capacity

By default, an event journal is configured with a `capacity` of 10000 items. This creates a single array per partition, roughly the size of the capacity divided by the number of partitions. Thus, if the configured capacity is 10000 and the number of partitions is 271, we will create 271 arrays of size 36 (10000/271). If 
a `time-to-live` is configured, then an array of longs is also created that stores the expiration time for every item. 
A single array of the event journal keeps events that are only related to the map entries in that partition. In a lot of cases you may want to change this `capacity` number to something that better fits your needs. As the capacity is shared between partitions, keep in mind not to set it to a value which is too low for you. Setting the capacity to a number lower than the partition count will result in an error when initializing the event journal. 

Below is a declarative configuration example of an event journal with a `capacity` of 5000 items for a map and 10000 items for a cache:

```
<event-journal enabled="true">
    <mapName>myMap</mapName>
    <capacity>5000</capacity>
    <time-to-live-seconds>20</time-to-live-seconds>
</event-journal>

<event-journal enabled="true">
    <cacheName>myCache</cacheName>
    <capacity>10000</capacity>
    <time-to-live-seconds>0</time-to-live-seconds>
</event-journal>
``` 

You can also configure an event journal programmatically. The following is a programmatic version of the above declarative configuration:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/EventJournalConfiguration.java[tag=ejc]
----


The `mapName` and `cacheName` attributes define the map or cache to which this event journal configuration applies. You can use pattern-matching and the `default` keyword when doing so. For instance, by using a `mapName` of `journaled*`, the journal configuration will apply to all maps whose names start with "journaled" and don't have other journal configurations that match (e.g., if you would have a more specific journal configuration with an exact name match). If you specify the `mapName` or `cacheName` as `default`, the journal configuration will apply to all maps and caches that don't have any other journal configuration. This means that potentially all maps and/or caches will have one single event journal configuration.

[[event-journal-partitioning]]
==== Event Journal Partitioning

The event journal is a partitioned data structure. The partitioning is done by the event key. Because of this, the map and cache entry with a specific key is co-located with the events for that key and will be migrated accordingly.
Also, the backup count for the event journal is equal to the backup count of the map or cache for which it contains events. The events on the backup replicas will be created with the map or cache backup operations and no additional network traffic is introduced when appending events to the event journal. 

[[configuring-event-journal-ttl]]
==== Configuring Event Journal time-to-live

You can configure Hazelcast event journal with a `time-to-live` in seconds. Using this setting, you can control how long the items remain in 
the event journal before they are expired. By default, the `time-to-live` is set to 0, meaning that unless the item is overwritten, 
it will remain in the journal indefinitely. The expiration time of the existing journal events is checked whenever a new event is appended to the event journal or when the event journal is being read. If the journal is not being read or written to, the journal may keep expired items indefinitely. 

In the example below, an event journal is configured with a `time-to-live` of 180 seconds:

```
<event-journal enabled="true">
    <cacheName>myCache</cacheName>
    <capacity>10000</capacity>
    <time-to-live-seconds>180</time-to-live-seconds>
</event-journal>
```
