=== JCache Setup and Configuration

This section shows what is necessary to provide
the JCache API and the Hazelcast JCache implementation
for your application. In addition, it demonstrates the
different configuration options and describes the
configuration properties.

==== Setting up Your Application

To provide your application with this JCache functionality,
your application needs the JCache API inside its classpath.
This API is the bridge between the specified JCache standard
and the implementation provided by Hazelcast.

The method of integrating the JCache API JAR into the
application classpath depends on the build system used.
For Maven, Gradle, SBT,
Ivy and many other build systems, all using Maven-based
dependency repositories, perform the integration by adding
the Maven coordinates to the build descriptor.

As already mentioned, you have to add JCache
coordinates next to the default Hazelcast coordinates
that might be already part of the application.

For Maven users, the coordinates look like the following code:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.cache</groupId>
    <artifactId>cache-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.1</version>
</dependency>
----

With other build systems, you might need to describe
the coordinates in a different way.

===== Activating Hazelcast as JCache Provider

To activate Hazelcast as the JCache provider implementation,
add either `hazelcast-all.jar` or
`hazelcast.jar` to the classpath (if not already available)
by either one of the following Maven snippets.

If you use `hazelcast-all.jar`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-all</artifactId>
    <version>"your Hazelcast version"</version>
</dependency>
----

If you use `hazelcast.jar`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>"your Hazelcast version"</version>
</dependency>
----

The users of other build systems have to adjust the
definition of the dependency to their needs.

===== Connecting Clients to Remote Member

When the users want to use Hazelcast clients to connect to
a remote cluster, the `hazelcast-client.jar` dependency is also required
on the client side applications. This JAR is already included
in `hazelcast-all.jar`. Or, you can add it to the classpath using the following
Maven snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-client</artifactId>
    <version>"your Hazelcast version, e.g. 3.10"</version>
</dependency>
----

For other build systems, for instance, ANT, the users
have to download these dependencies from either the JSR-107
specification and
Hazelcast community website (link:https://hazelcast.org/[hazelcast.org^])
or from the Maven repository search page
(link:http://search.maven.org[maven.org^]).

==== Example JCache Application

Before moving on to configuration, let's have a look at a
basic introductory example. The following code shows how to
use the Hazelcast JCache integration
inside an application in an easy but typesafe way.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/jcache/ExampleJCacheApplication.java[tag=jcacheapp]
----

Although the example is simple, let's go through the code
lines one by one.

===== Getting the Hazelcast JCache Implementation

First of all, we retrieve the `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider`
using the static method from
`javax.cache.Caching.getCachingManager()`, which automatically
picks up Hazelcast as the underlying JCache implementation, if
available in the classpath. This way, the Hazelcast implementation
of a `CachingProvider` automatically starts a new Hazelcast
member or client (depending on the chosen provider type) and
pick up the configuration from either the command line parameter
or from the classpath. We will show how to use an existing
`HazelcastInstance` later in this chapter; for now, we keep
it simple.

===== Setting up the JCache Entry Point

In the next line, we ask the `CachingProvider` to return a
`javax.cache.CacheManager`. This is the general application's entry
point into JCache. The `CacheManager` creates and manages
named caches.

===== Configuring the Cache Before Creating It

The next few lines create a simple
`javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration` to configure
the cache before actually
creating it. In this case, we only configure the key and value
types to make the cache typesafe which is highly recommended and
checked on retrieval of the cache.

===== Creating the Cache

To create the cache, we call `javax.cache.CacheManager.createCache()`
with a name for the cache and the previously created
configuration; the call returns the created cache. If you need to
retrieve a previously created cache, you can use the corresponding
method overload `javax.cache.CacheManager.getCache()`. If the cache
was created using type parameters, you must retrieve the cache
afterward using the type checking version of `getCache`.

===== get, put and getAndPut

The following lines are simple `put` and `get` calls from the
`java.util.Map` interface. The
`javax.cache.Cache.put()` has a `void` return type and does
not return the previously assigned value of the key. To imitate the
`java.util.Map.put()` method, the JCache cache has a method
called `getAndPut`.

==== Configuring for JCache

Hazelcast JCache provides two different methods for cache configuration:

* declaratively: using `hazelcast.xml` or `hazelcast-client.xml`
* programmatically: the typical Hazelcast way, using the Config API seen above

[[jcache-declarative-configuration]]
===== Declarative Configuration

You can declare your JCache cache configuration using the
`hazelcast.xml` or `hazelcast-client.xml` configuration files.
Using this declarative configuration makes creating the `javax.cache.Cache`
fully transparent and automatically ensures internal thread safety.
You do not need a call to `javax.cache.Cache.createCache()` in this case:
you can retrieve the cache using
`javax.cache.Cache.getCache()` overloads and by passing in the name defined
in the configuration for the cache.

To retrieve the cache that you defined in the declaration files, you only need
to perform a simple call (example below) because the cache is
created automatically by the implementation.

[source,java]
----
CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();
CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider.getCacheManager();
Cache<Object, Object> cache = cacheManager
    .getCache( "default", Object.class, Object.class );
----

Note that this section only describes the JCache provided
standard properties. For the Hazelcast specific properties,
see the <<icache-configuration, ICache Configuration section>>.

    ...
</hazelcast>
----

* `key-type#class-name`: Fully qualified class name of the cache
key type. Its default value is `java.lang.Object`.
* `value-type#class-name`: Fully qualified class name of the
cache value type. Its default value is `java.lang.Object`.
* `statistics-enabled`: If set to true, statistics like cache
hits and misses are collected. Its default value is false.
* `management-enabled`: If set to true, JMX beans are enabled
and collected statistics are provided. It doesn't automatically
enable statistics collection. Its default value is false.
* `read-through`: If set to true, enables read-through behavior of
the cache to an underlying configured `javax.cache.integration.CacheLoader`
which is also known as lazy-loading. Its default value is false.
* `write-through`: If set to true, enables write-through behavior of the
cache to an underlying configured `javax.cache.integration.CacheWriter`
which passes any changed value to the external backend resource.
Its default value is false.
* `cache-loader-factory#class-name`: Fully qualified class name of the
`javax.cache.configuration.Factory` implementation providing a
`javax.cache.integration.CacheLoader` instance to the cache.
* `cache-writer-factory#class-name`: Fully qualified class name of the
`javax.cache.configuration.Factory` implementation providing a
`javax.cache.integration.CacheWriter` instance to the cache.
* `expiry-policy-factory#-class-name`: Fully qualified class name of the
`javax.cache.configuration.Factory` implementation providing a
`javax.cache.expiry.ExpiryPolicy` instance to the cache.
* `cache-entry-listener`: A set of attributes and elements,
explained below, to describe a `javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener`.
** `cache-entry-listener#old-value-required`: If set to true,
previously assigned values for the affected keys are sent to the
`javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener` implementation. Setting this
attribute to true creates additional traffic. Its default value is false.
** `cache-entry-listener#synchronous`: If set to true, the
`javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener` implementation is called
in a synchronous manner. Its default value is false.
** `cache-entry-listener/entry-listener-factory#class-name`: Fully
qualified class name of the `javax.cache.configuration.Factory`
implementation providing a `javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener` instance.
** `cache-entry-listener/entry-event-filter-factory#class-name`:
Fully qualified class name of the `javax.cache.configuration.Factory`
implementation providing a `javax.cache.event.CacheEntryEventFilter` instance.

NOTE: The JMX MBeans provided by Hazelcast JCache show statistics of the local member only.
To show the cluster-wide statistics, the user should collect
statistic information from all members and accumulate them to
the overall statistics.

[[jcache-programmatic-configuration]]
===== Programmatic Configuration

To configure the JCache programmatically:

* either instantiate `javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration` if you will use
only the JCache standard configuration,
* or instantiate `com.hazelcast.config.CacheConfig` for a deeper Hazelcast integration.

`com.hazelcast.config.CacheConfig` offers additional options that
are specific to Hazelcast, such as asynchronous and synchronous backup counts.
Both classes share the same supertype interface
`javax.cache.configuration.CompleteConfiguration` which is part of the JCache
standard.

NOTE: To stay vendor independent, try to keep your code as near as
possible to the standard JCache API. We recommend that you use declarative
configuration and that you use the `javax.cache.configuration.Configuration`
or `javax.cache.configuration.CompleteConfiguration` interfaces in
your code only when you need to pass the configuration instance throughout your code.

If you don't need to configure Hazelcast specific properties, we recommend that you instantiate
`javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration` and that you use the
setters to configure Hazelcast as shown in the example in the
<<example-jcache-application, Example JCache Application section>>.
Since the configurable properties are the same as the ones explained in the
<<jcache-declarative-configuration, JCache Declarative Configuration section>>,
they are not mentioned here. For Hazelcast specific properties, please read the
<<icache-configuration, ICache Configuration section>> section.
