== Database CDC Integration using Striim Hot Cache

[blue]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise*

Change Data Capture (CDC) refers to the technology for identifying and capturing
changes made to a data source. These changes can then be applied to
another data repository or made available in a format supported by
data integration tools.

link:https://www.striim.com/[Striim^] is a real-time data integration
and streaming analytics software platform. It uses
CDC (Change Data Capture) mechanism to detect changes performed on
a data source.

Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache, the integration solution of Hazelcast and Striim,
enables real-time, push-based propagation of changes from the database to the cache.
The following sections describe this integration.

[[striim-cdc-introduction]]
=== Introduction

Through CDC, Striim is able to recognize which tables and key values have changed.
It immediately captures these changes with their table and key, and pushes the changes
into a cache. Supported databases are Oracle, My SQL and Microsoft SQL Server.

When it comes to Hazelcast, you can get the changes in a database and
put them into your Hazelcast IMDG member
using a "writer" developed by Striim, i.e., Hazelcast Writer. This writer
creates a Hazelcast client once you start Striim, to connect to your IMDG member.


[[striim-cdc-supported-versions]]
=== Supported Versions

This integration only works with Hazelcast IMDG **3.x versions**. Support for 4.x will be added in the near future.

[[striim-cdc-logging]]
=== Logging

You can enable logging to see the status of the Hazelcast client created by the Hazelcast Writer.
For this, you need to add the following line to the `server.sh` file
on the machine where Striim is running:

[source]
----
-Dhazelcast.logging.type=log4j
----

The `server.sh` file is typically located at the `/opt/striim/bin` directory.

You can also set the logging level by adding the following
line to the `log4j.server.properties` file:

[source]
----
log4j.logger.com.hazelcast=debug
----

The `log4j.server.properties` file is typically located at the `/opt/striim/conf` directory.

In the above example line, the logging level is set as `DEBUG`. The
following lists all the available levels:

* `TRACE`
* `DEBUG`
* `INFO`
* `WARN`
* `ERROR`
* `OFF`

The logs are written into the `striim.server.log` which is typically located
at the `/opt/striim/logs` directory.

The above settings are for the Hazelcast Client created by the writer.
You can also change the logging level dynamically for Hazelcast Writer. Follow the
below instructions for this:

. Open the Striim console using the `console.sh` command.
See link:https://www.striim.com/docs/en/console-commands.html[here^]
for the usage of this command.
. While in the console, run the following command:
+
[source]
----
set loglevel = {com.webaction.proc.HazelcastWriter_1_0:debug};
----

=== Fully Working Example Application

We have created an link:https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/striim-hazelcast-cdc[example application^] with step-by-step instructions. The application guides you on how to load data from an
Oracle database using the Striim Hazelcast Writer. We recommend you
start there before working with your own application.
