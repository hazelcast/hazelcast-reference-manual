== Hazelcast Plugins

This chapter describes the plugins using which you can extend Hazelcast IMDG's functionalities.

=== Cloud Discovery Plugins

Hazelcast provides the following plugins that allow Hazelcast cluster members to discover each other on the cloud platforms. Cloud discovery plugins are useful when you do not want to provide or you cannot provide the list of possible IP addresses on various cloud providers.

==== Hazelcast jclouds®

https://jclouds.apache.org/[Apache jclouds®] is an open source multi-cloud library for the Java platform which lets you create applications that are portable across clouds and gives you the full control to use cloud-specific features. Hazelcast members and native clients support Apache jclouds® for discovery.

You can configure your cluster to use jclouds® discovery by adding `hazelcast-jclouds.jar` dependency to your project and enabling Hazelcast's Discovery SPI. Since jclouds® depends on various libraries, you also need to configure its dependencies using build automation tools like Maven. Note that you can also define multiple regions in your jclouds® configuration; the members can find each other over a different region.

See Hazelcast jclouds® plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jclouds/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast AWS

https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS] is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. Hazelcast supports discovering members within Amazon EC2 cloud using Hazelcast AWS cloud discovery plugin.

You can easily configure your cluster to use EC2 discovery by adding `hazelcast-aws.jar` dependency to your project and enabling Hazelcast's Discovery SPI. This plugin does not depend on any other third party modules. Note that this plugin puts the zone information into the Hazelcast's member attributes map during the discovery process; you can use its `ZONE_AWARE` configuration to create backups in other Availability Zones (AZ). Each zone will be accepted as one partition group. Note that, when using the ZONE_AWARE partition grouping, a Hazelcast cluster spanning multiple AZs should have an equal number of members in each AZ. Otherwise, it will result in uneven partition distribution among the members.

See Hazelcast AWS plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast GCP

Hazelcast supports discovering members in the https://cloud.google.com/compute/[GCP Compute Engine] environment.

You can easily configure Hazelcast members discovery, WAN replication and Hazelcast clients to work seamlessly on the native GCP VM Instances. This plugin supports `ZONE_AWARE` configuration to create backups in separate zones to prevent data loss in the case of a zone outage. This plugin also supports discovering a Hazelcast cluster deployed on GCP by the Hazelcast client running outside of the GCP infrastructure.

See Hazelcast GCP plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-gcp/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast Azure

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/[Microsoft Azure] is a cloud computing service provided by Microsoft for managing applications through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. Hazelcast Azure plugin provides a discovery strategy for Hazelcast enabled applications running on Microsoft Azure. It provides all Hazelcast instances by returning VMs within your Azure resource group that are tagged with a specified value.

To use this plugin in your Java project, simply add the Azure dependency to your Maven or Gradle configurations and enable Hazelcast's Discovery SPI. Then you will need to configure a couple of properties at both Hazelcast and Azure sides.

See Hazelcast Azure plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-azure/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.


==== Hazelcast Consul

https://www.consul.io/[Consul] is a distributed service mesh to connect, secure and configure services across any public or private cloud platforms. This plugin provides a Consul based discovery strategy for Hazelcast clusters.

You can add the Consul dependency to your Maven or Gradle configurations and enable Hazelcast's Discovery SPI to use this plugin. You can then start Consul in your network and set the Consul related properties in your Hazelcast configuration.

See Hazelcast Consul plugin's https://github.com/bitsofinfo/hazelcast-consul-discovery-spi/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.


==== Hazelcast etcd

https://coreos.com/etcd/[etcd] is an open-source distributed key value store that provides shared configuration and service discovery for Container Linux clusters. This plugin enables the Hazelcast members to dynamically discover each other through etcd.

Add the etcd dependency to either your Maven or Gradle configurations and enable Hazelcast's Discovery SPI. Then start etcd in your network and set the etcd related properties (such username, password and registrator) in your Hazelcast configuration.

See Hazelcast etcd plugin's https://github.com/bitsofinfo/hazelcast-etcd-discovery-spi/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast Eureka

https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki[Eureka] is a REST based service that is primarily used in the AWS cloud to for load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers, and Hazelcast supports Eureka V1 discovery.

To use this plugin, add the `hazelcast-eureka-one.jar` dependency to your project and enable Hazelcast's Discovery SPI. You will also need to specify the Eureka properties file.

See Hazelcast Eureka plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-eureka/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast IMDG and Jet for PCF

https://pivotal.io/platform[Pivotal Cloud Foundry](PCF) is an open source cloud platform on which you can build, deploy, run and scale applications. You can deploy your Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise or Hazelcast Jet clusters on PCF using clickable tiles.

After you install and configure Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise or Hazelcast Jet for PCF, you can create services, and configure WAN replications, user code deployments and TLS.

See Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise for PCF https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/hazelcast/index.html[documentation] and Hazelcast Jet for PCF https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/hazelcast-jet/[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast OpenShift

https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift] is an open source container application platform by Red Hat based on top of Docker containers and the Kubernetes container cluster manager for application development and deployment. Hazelcast can run inside OpenShift.

You can use Kubernetes for discovery of Hazelcast members. By using Hazelcast Docker images, templates and default configuration files, you can deploy Hazelcast IMDG, Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise and Management Center onto OpenShift.

See Hazelcast IMDG for OpenShift https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-openshift[documentation] and Hazelcast Management Center for OpenShift https://github.com/hazelcast/management-center-openshift[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast Heroku

https://www.heroku.com/[Heroku] is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages so that you can build, run and operate applications entirely in the cloud. This plugin offers a discovery strategy that looks for IP addresses of members by resolving service names against the Heroku DNS Discovery in Heroku Private Spaces.

You can use this plugin by adding the `hazelcast-heroku-dependency` to your Maven or Gradle configurations and enabling Hazelcast's Discovery SPI. By default there is no configuration needed, but you can configure the service names or initial run delay for the merge after a Split-Brain.

See Hazelcast Heroku plugin's https://github.com/jkutner/hazelcast-heroku-discovery[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast Kubernetes

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes[Kubernetes] is an open source container orchestration system to automate deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. This plugin looks up the IP addresses of Hazelcast members by resolving the requests against a Kubernetes Service Discovery system. It supports two different options of resolving against the discovery registry: a request to the REST API and DNS lookup against a given DNS service name.

To use this plugin, add the `hazelcast-kubernetes` dependency to your Maven or Gradle configurations and enable Hazelcast's Discovery SPI. You will need to configure Hazelcast according to the option you want the plugin to use, i.e., REST API or DNS lookup.

See Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast Zookeeper

https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Zookeeper] by Apache is a centralized service to maintain configuration information, naming, and to provide distributed synchronization and group services. This plugin provides a service based discovery strategy for your Hazelcast applications by using Apache Curator to communicate with your Zookeeper server.

To use this plugin, add the Curator dependencies to your Maven or Gradle configurations and enable Hazelcast's Discovery SPI. Thereafter, you will need to configure properties such as the URL of Zookeeper server and cluster ID.

See Hazelcast Zookeeper plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-zookeeper/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.

=== Integration Plugins

Hazelcast provides the following integration plugins that allow Hazelcast to integrate with other frameworks and applications smoothly.

==== Spring Data Hazelcast

http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data] provides a consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while preserving the features of the underlying data store. This plugin provides Spring Data repository support for Hazelcast IMDG. This integration enables the Spring Data paradigm to gain the power of a distributed data repository.

To use this plugin, add the Spring Data dependency to your Maven or Gradle configurations and specify the base packages and repositories.

See Spring Data Hazelcast plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/spring-data-hazelcast[documentation] for more information.

==== Spring Integration Extension for Hazelcast

This plugin provides https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration[Spring Integration] extensions for Hazelcast. These extensions are included but limited to the following:

* Event-driven inbound channel adapter: Listens related Hazelcast data structure events and sends event messages to the defined channel.
* Continuous query inbound channel adapter: Listens the modifications performed on specific map entries.
* Cluster monitor inbound channel adapter:  Listen the modifications performed on the cluster.
* Distributed SQL inbound channel adapter: Runs the defined distributed SQL and returns the results in the light of iteration type.
* Outbound channel adapter: Listens the defined channel and writes the incoming messages to the related distributed data structure.
* Leader election: Elects a cluster member, for example, for highly available message consumer where only one member should receive messages.

See Spring Integration Extension for Hazelcast https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-extensions/tree/master/spring-integration-hazelcast[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast JCA Resource Adapter

Hazelcast JCA Resource Adapter is a system-level software driver which can be used by a Java application to connect to an Hazelcast cluster. Using this adapter, you can integrate Hazelcast into Java EE containers. After a proper configuration, Hazelcast can participate in standard Java EE transactions.

Deploying and configuring the Hazelcast JCA Resource Adapter is not different than configuring any other resource adapters since it is a standard JCA one. However, resource adapter installation and configuration is container-specific, so you will need to consult with your Java EE vendor documentation for details.

See Hazelcast JCA Resource Adapter https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-ra[documentation] for information on configuring the resource adapter, Glassfish applications and JBoss web applications.

===== Integrating with MuleSoft

Hazelcast is embedded within a MuleSoft container as an out-of-the-box offering. For a proper integration you should edit the `mule-deploy.properties` file to have the following entry:

```
loader.override=com.hazelcast
```

==== Hazelcast Grails

https://grails.org/[Grails] is an open source web application framework that uses the Apache Groovy programming language. This plugin integrates Hazelcast data distribution framework into your Grails application. You can reach the distributed data structures by injecting the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-grails/blob/master/grails-app/services/hazelgrails/HazelService.groovy[HazelService]. Also you can cache your domain class into Hazelcast distributed cache.

See Hazelcast Grails plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-grails[documentation] and https://blog.hazelcast.com/distribute-grails-with-hazelcast/[this blogpost] for more information.

==== Hazelcast Hibernate 2LC

http://hibernate.org/[Hibernate] is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database and enables developers to more easily write applications whose data outlives the application process. This plugin provides Hazelcast's own distributed second level cache implementation for your Hibernate (versions 3, 4 and 5) entities, collections and queries.

To use this plugin, add the Hazelcast Hibernate dependency into your classpath depending on your Hibernate version. Then you will need to specify various properties in your Hibernate configuration such as the `RegionFactory` and query cache properties.

See the documentation of this plugin for https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-hibernate/blob/master/README.md[Hibernate 3.x, 4.x] and for https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-hibernate5/blob/master/README.md[Hibernate 5.x].

==== Hazelcast DynaCache

https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/linuxonibm/liaag/cache/pubwasdynacachoverview.htm[DynaCache] by IBM is used to store objects, and later, based on some data matching rules, to retrieve those objects and serve them from its cache.  This plugin is for Liberty Profile which is a lightweight profile of IBM WebSphere Application Server.

In the Liberty Profile, you can use a dynamic cache engine in order to cache your data. With this plugin, you can use Hazelcast as a cache provider.

See Hazelcast DynaCache plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-dynacache/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.

==== Hazelcast Connector for Kafka

This plugin allows you to write events from https://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] to HazelCast. It takes the value from the Kafka Connect SinkRecords and inserts/updates an entry in Hazelcast. It supports writing to Hazelcast distributed data structures including Reliable Topic, Ringbuffer, Queue, Set, List, Map, MultiMap and ICache (Hazelcast's JCache extension).

See the plugin's https://lenses.stream/connectors/sink/hazelcast.html[documentation] for more information.

==== Openfire

https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/[Openfire] is an open source real time collaboration server. It uses XMPP which is an open protocol for instant messaging.  This plugin adds support for running multiple redundant Openfire servers together in a cluster.

By running Openfire as a cluster, you can distribute the connection load among several servers, while also providing failover in the event of failures.

See the plugin's https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins/hazelcast/readme.html[documentation] for more information.

==== SubZero

https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo[Kryo] is a popular serialization library. It is fast, easy to use, and it does not pollute your domain model. It can even serialize classes which are not marked as Serializable.

Hazelcast has no out-of-the box support for Kryo. Although it is rather easy to integrate it, everyone has to write the same code and face the same bugs. This plugin, SubZero, simplifies the integration of Hazelcast and Kryo. Simply add SubZero dependency to your Maven or Gradle configurations, and add the SubZero plugin as a global serializer (if you want to use it for all classes in your project) or as a serializer (to have the option of selecting the classes in your project).

See the plugin's https://github.com/jerrinot/subzero/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for more information.

=== Web Sessions Clustering Plugins

Hazelcast offers the following plugins to allow you cluster your web sessions using Servlet Filter, Tomcat and Jetty based solutions.

==== Filter Based Web Session Replication

This plugin (a.k.a. Generic Web Session Replication) provides HTTP session replication capabilities across a Hazelcast cluster in order to handle failover cases. Assuming you have multiple web servers with load balancers; if one server goes down, your users on that server will be directed to one of the other live servers, but their sessions will be lost. Using this plugin backs up these HTTP sessions; it clusters them automatically. To use it, put the `hazelcast-wm` JAR file into your `WEB-INF/lib` folder and configure your `web.xml` file according to your needs.

See the plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-wm/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for information on configuring and using it.

You can also see the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/filter-based-session-replication[sample application] which uses filter based web session replication.

Note that filter based web session replication has the option to use a map with High-Density Memory Store, is available in [navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*, to keep your session objects. Please refer to the <<high-density-memory-store, High-Density Memory Store section>> for details on this feature.

==== Tomcat Based Web Session Replication

Tomcat based web session replication is offered through Hazelcast Tomcat Session Manager. It is a container specific module that enables session replication for JEE Web Applications without requiring changes to the application.

See the plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-tomcat-sessionmanager/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for information on configuring and using it.

You can also see the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/manager-based-session-replication[sample application] which uses Tomcat based web session replication.


==== Jetty Based Web Session Replication

Jetty based web session replication is offered through Hazelcast Jetty Session Manager. It is a container specific module that enables session replication for JEE Web Applications without requiring changes to the application.

See the plugin's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jetty-sessionmanager[documentation] for information on configuring and using it.

You can also see the https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/tree/master/hazelcast-integration/manager-based-session-replication[sample application] which uses Jetty based web session replication.


=== Big Data Plugins

Hazelcast offers integrations with https://spark.apache.org/[Apache Spark] and https://mesos.apache.org/[Apache Mesos].

Apache Spark is an open source cluster-computing platform which has become one of the key big data distributed processing frameworks. There is a Spark connector for Hazelcast which allows your Spark applications to connect to a Hazelcast cluster with the Spark RDD API. See this integration's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-spark/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for information on  configuring and using it.

Apache Mesos is an open source cluster manager that handles workloads efficiently in a distributed environment through dynamic resource sharing and isolation; you can run any distributed application that requires clustered resources. It is widely used to manage big data infrastructures. Hazelcast Mesos integration gives you the ability to deploy Hazelcast on the Mesos cluster. See this integration's https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-mesos/blob/master/README.md[documentation] for information on configuring and using it.
