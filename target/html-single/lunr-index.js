For more information, please see the [Back Pressure section](#back-pressure). - **Client Configuration Import**: Hazelcast now supports replacing variables with system properties in the declarative configuration of Hazelcast client. Moreover, now you can compose the Hazelcast client declarative configuration out of smaller configuration snippets. For more information, please see the [Composing Declarative Configuration section](#composing-declarative-configuration). - **Cluster Quorum**: This feature enables you to define the minimum number of machines required in a cluster for the cluster to remain in an operational state. For more information, please see  the [Cluster Quorum section](#cluster-quorum). - **Hazelcast Client Protocol**: Starting with 3.5, Hazelcast introduces the support for different versions of clients in a cluster. Please keep in mind that this support is not valid for the releases before 3.5. Please see the important note at the last paragraph of the [Hazelcast Java Client chapter's](#hazelcast-java-client) introduction. - **Listener for Lost Partitions**: This feature notifies you for possible data loss occurrences. Please see the [Partition Lost Listener section](#partition-lost-listener) and [MapPartitionLostListener section](#mappartitionlostlistener). - **Increased Visibility of Slow Operations**: With the introduction of the `SlowOperationDetector` feature, slow operations are logged and can be seen on the Hazelcast Management Center. Please see the [SlowOperationDetector section](#slowoperationdetector) and [Management Center:Members section](#members). - **Enterprise WAN Replication**: Hazelcast Enterprise implementation of the WAN Replication. Please see the [Enterprise WAN Replication section](#enterprise-wan-replication). - **Sub-Listener Interfaces for Map Listener**: This feature enables you to listen to map-wide or entry-based events. With this new feature, the listener formerly known as `EntryListener` has been changed to `MapListener` and `MapListener` has sub-interfaces to catch map/entry related events. Please see the [Map Listener section](#map-listener) for more information. - **Scalable Map Loader**: With this feature, you can load your keys incrementally if the number of your keys is large. Please see the [Incremental Key Loading section](#incremental-key-loading). - **Near Cache for JCache**: Now you can use a near cache with Hazelcast's JCache implementation. Please see [JCache Near Cache](#jcache-near-cache) for details.  - **Fail Fast on Invalid Configuration**: With this feature, Hazelcast throws a meaningful exception if there is an error in the declarative or programmatic configuration. Please see the note at the end of the [Configuration Overview section](#configuration-overview). - **Continuous Query Caching**: (Enterprise only, since 3.5) Provides an always up to date view of an IMap according to the given predicate. Please see the [Continuous Query Cache section](#continuous-query-cache)  - Dynamic Selector Rebalancing - Management of Unbounded Return Values        "

    title: "Enhancements",
    body: "### Enhancements  **3.5.1 Enhancements**  The following are the enhancements performed for Hazelcast 3.5.1 release.  - Client instances should spawn threads with their instance names added as prefix [[#5671]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5671). - The method `com.hazelcast.spi.impl.classicscheduler.ResponseThread::process` may catch throwables. When this occurs, it logs an unhelpful message, and ignores the actual exception. This method should be improved to additionally log the cause, or at least the exception class and message [[#5619]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5619). - The element `min-eviction-check-millis` in the map configuration does not exist in documentation [[#5614]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5614).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   **3.5 Enhancements**  This section lists the enhancements performed for Hazelcast 3.5 release.  - **Eventing System Improvements**: RingBuffer and Reliable Topic structures are introduced. - **XA Transactions Improvements**: With this improvement, you can now obtain a Hazelcast XA Resource instance through `HazelcastInstance`. For more information, please see [XA Transactions](#xa-transactions). - **Query and Indexing Improvements**   The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.   - While configuring JCache, duration of the `ExpiryPolicy` can be set programmatically but not declaratively [[#5347]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5347). - Since near cache is not supported as embedded but only at client, at the moment, there is no need for `NearCacheConfig` in `CacheConfig` [[#5215]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5215). - Support for parametrized test is needed [[#5182]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5182). - `SlowOperationDetector` should have an option to not to log the stacktraces to the log file. There is no need to have the stacktraces written to the normal log file if the Hazelcast Management Center or the performance monitor is being used [[#5043]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5043). - The batch launcher should include the JCache API [[#4902]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4902). - There are no Spring tags available for Native Memory configuration [[#4772]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4772). - In the class `BasicInvocationFuture`, there is no need to create an additional `AtomicInteger` object. It should be replaced with `AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater` [[#4408]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4408). - There is no need to use the class `IsStillExecutingOperation` to check if an operation is running locally. One can directly access to the scheduler [[#4407]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4407). - Configuring NearCache in a Client/Server system only talks about the programmatic configuration of NearCache on the clients. The declarative configuration (XML) of the same is not mentioned [[#4376]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4376). - XML schema and XML configuration validation is not compliant for AWS configuration [[#4310]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4310). - The JavaDoc for the methods `KeyValueSource.hasNext/element/key` and `Iterator.hasNext/next` should emphasize the differences between each other, i.e. the state changing behavior should be clarified [[#4218]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4218). - While migration is in progress, the nodes will have different partition state versions. If the query is running at that time, it can get results from the nodes at different stages of the migration. By adding partition state version to the query results, it can be checked whether the migration was happening and the query can be re-run [[#4206]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4206). - XML Config Schema does not allow to set a `SecurityInterceptor` Implementation [[#4118]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4118). - Currently, certain types of remote executed calls are stored into the `executingCalls` map. The key (and value) is a `RemoteCallKey` object. The functionality provided is the ability to ask on the remote side if an operation is still executing. For a partition-aware operation, this is not needed. When an operation is scheduled by a partition specific operation thread, the operation can be stored in a volatile field in that thread [[#4079]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4079). - The class `TcpIpJoinerOverAWS` fails at AWS' recently launched eu-central-1 region. The reason for the fail is that the region requires v4 signatures [[#3963]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3963). - API change in `EntryListener` breaks the compatibility with the Camel Hazelcast component [[#3859]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3859). - The `hazelcast-spring-&lt;`*version*`&gt;.xsd` should include the User Defined Services (SPI) elements and attributes [[#3565]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3565). - XA Transactions run on multiple threads [[#3385]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3385). - Hazelcast client fails to connect when you provide variables from the system properties [[#3270]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3270). - Entry listeners are not called when the entries are modified by WAN replication [[#2981]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2981). - Map wildcard matching is confusing. There should be a pluggable wildcard configuration resolver [[#2431]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2431). - The method `loadAllKeys()` in map is not scalable [[#2266]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2266). - Back pressure feature should be added [[#1781]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/1781).

    url: "hazelcast-documentation.html#fixes",
    title: "Fixes",
    body: "### Fixes  **3.5.2 Fixes**  The following are the issues solved for Hazelcast 3.5.2 release.  - There is a performance issue: Even when the Spring boot application is doing nothing, CPU consumption is very high. A thread named \&quot;.hazelcast-wm.ensureInstance\&quot; consumes CPU around 70% because of the method `ClusteredSessionService.run()` [[#6052]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6052). - MapLoader blocks the entire partition when loading a single entry [[#5818]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5818). - The method `IMap.getAll` by-passes interceptors in the Hazelcast 3.3 and higher versions [[#5775]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5775). - `AWSJoiner` fails for the regions except us-east-1 [[#5653]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5653). - Getting an instance of `sun.misc.Unsafe` class does not work on HP-UX operating system [[#5518]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5518). - `AWSAddressTranslator` always uses the default region and this causes the HazelcastClient to be unable to join a Hazelcast AWS cluster in a non-default region [[#5446]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5446). - The test code `JettyWebFilterTest.java` does not fail properly [[#5188]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5188). - Management Center behaves unfriendly when map entries increase [[#4895]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4895). - In `hazelcast-client.xml`, if the region is configured but `host-header` is not provided, the configuration gives a default endpoint value of `ec2.amazonaws.com`. It should give, for example, `ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com` when the region is eu-west-1 and `host-header` is not provided [[#4731]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4731). - Too much CPU is used when Hazelcast is idle [[#81]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/81).    **3.5.1 Fixes**  The following are the issues solved for Hazelcast 3.5.1 release.  - Hazelcast Management Center uses `UpdateMapConfigOperation` to update map configurations. This operation simply replaces the map configuration of the related map container. However, this replacement has no effect for `maxIdleSeconds` and `timeToLiveSeconds` properties of the map configuration since they are not used in the map container directly. They are assigned to the final variables during map container creation and never touched again [[#5593]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5593). - Destroying a map just after creating it produces double create/destroy events for `DistributedObjectListener` [[#5592]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5592). - Map does not allow changing its maximum size, TTL and maximum idle properties. However, these fields are editable in the \&quot;Map Config\&quot; popup of Management Center. These fields should be disabled to prevent misguiding [[#5591]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5591). - Map is destroyed using `IMap.destroy()` but then it is immediately recreated [[#5554]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5554). - There should be a better calculation when calling the method `getApproximateMaxSize()` related to casting. Its return type is `int` and this causes the map entries to be evicted all the time when, for example, the eviction policy for an IMap is set to heap percentage with the value 1% [[#5516]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5516). - All `onResponse()` calls on a `MultiExecutionCallback` should be made before the method `onComplete()` is called. There exists a race condition in `ExecutionCallbackAdapterFactory` which permits the method `onComplete()` to be called before all `onReponse()` calls are made [[#5490]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5490). - Hazelcast Management Center \&quot;Scripting\&quot; tab is not refreshed when a new node joins to the cluster [[#4738]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4738). - When updating a map entry which is replicated over WAN, the TTL (time to live) is not honored in the remote cluster map. When the timeout expires, the entry disappears from the cluster in which the key is owned, however it remains in the remote cluster [[#254]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/254).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  **3.5 Fixes**  The following are the issues solved for Hazelcast 3.5 release.  - Operation timeout mechanism is not working [[#5468]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5468). - `MapLoader` exception is not logged: Exception should be logged and propagated back to the client that triggered the loading of the map [[#5430]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5430). - Replicated Map documentation page does not mention that it is in the beta stage [[#5424]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5424). - The method `XAResource.rollback()` should not need the transaction to be in the prepared state when called from another member/client [[#5401]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5401). - The method `XAResource.end()` should not need to check `threadId` [[#5400]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5400). - The method `IList::remove()` should publish the event `REMOVED` [[#5386]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5386). - `IllegalStateException` with wrong partition is thrown when the method `IMap::getOperation()` is invoked [[#5341]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5341). - `WrongTarget` warnings appear in the log since the operations are not sent to the replicas when a map has no backups [[#5324]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5324). - When the method `finalizeCombine()` is used, Hazelcast throws `NullPointerException` [[#5283]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5283). - `WanBatchReplication` causes `OutOfMemoryException` when the default value for WAN Replication Batch Size (50) is used [[#5280]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5280). - When testing Hazelcast, it does not start as an OSGI bundle. After the OSGI package was refactored, the dynamic class loading of the Script engine was missed [[#5274]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5274). - XA Example from Section 11.3.5 in the Reference Manual broken after the latest XA Improvements are committed [[#5273]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5273). - XA Transaction throws `TransactionException` instead of an `XAException` on timeout [[#5260]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5260). - The test for unbounded return values runs forever with the new client implementation [[#5230]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5230). - The new client method `getAsync()` fails with a `NegativeArraySizeException` [[#5229]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5229). - The method `putTransient` actuated the MapStore unexpectedly in an environment with multiple instances [[#5225]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5225). - Changes made by the interceptor do not appear in the backup [[#5211]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5211). - The method `removeAttribute` will prevent any updates by the method `setAttribute` in the deferred write mode [[#5186]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5186). - Backward compatibility of eviction configuration for cache is broken since `CacheEvictionConfig` class was renamed to `EvictionConfig` for general usage [[#5180]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5180). - Value passed into `ICompletableFuture.onResponse()` is not deserialized [[#5158]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5158). - Map Eviction section in the Reference Manual needs more clarification [[#5120]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5120). - When host names are not registered in DNS or in `/etc/hosts` and the members are configured manually with IP addresses and while one node is running, a second node joins to the cluster 5 minutes after it started [[#5072]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5072). - The method `OperationService.asyncInvokeOnPartition()` sometimes fails [[#5069]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5069). - The `SlowOperationDTO.operation` shows only the class name, not the package. This can lead to ambiguity and the actual class cannot be tracked [[#5041]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5041). - There is no documentation comment for the `MessageListener` interface of ITopic [[#5019]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5019). - The method `InvocationFuture.isDone` returns `true` as soon as there is a response including `WAIT_RESPONSE`. However, `WAIT_RESPONSE` is an intermediate response, not a final one [[#5002]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5002). - The method `InvocationFuture.andThen` does not deal with the null response correctly [[#5001]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5001). - `CacheCreationTest` fails due to the multiple `TestHazelcastInstanceFactory` creations in the same test [[#4987]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4987). - When Spring dependency is upgraded to 4.1.x, an exception related to the `putIfAbsent` method is thrown [[#4981]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4981). - HazelcastCacheManager should offer a way to access the underlying cache manager [[#4978]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4978). - Hazelcast Client code allows to use the value *0* for the `connectionAttemptLimit` property which internally results in `int.maxValue`. However, the XSD of the Hazelcast Spring configuration requires it to be at least 1 [[#4967]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4967). - Updates from Entry Processor does not take `write-coalescing` into account [[#4967]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4957). - CachingProvider does not honor custom URI [[#4943]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4943). - Test for the method `getLocalExecutorStats()` fails spuriously [[#4911]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4911). - Missing documentation of network configuration for JCache [[#4905]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4905). - Slow operation detector throws a `NullPointerException` [[#4855]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4855). - Consider use of `System.nanoTime` in `sleepAtLeast` test code [[#4835]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4835). - When upgraded to 3.5-SNAPSHOT for testing, Hazelcast project gives a warning that mentions a missing configuration for `hazelcastmq.txn-topic` [[#4790]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4790). - `ClassNotFoundException` when using WAR classes with JCache API [[#4775]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4775). - When Hazelcast is installed using Maven in Windows environment, the test `XmlConfigImportVariableReplacementTest` fails [[#4758]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4758). - When a request cannot be executed due to a problem (connection error, etc.), if the operation redo is enabled, request is retried.

    title: "Upgrading from 2.x",
    body: "### Upgrading from 2.x  - **Removal of deprecated static methods:** The static methods of Hazelcast class reaching Hazelcast data components have been removed. The functionality of these methods can be reached from HazelcastInstance interface. Namely you should replace following:  ```java Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; customers = Hazelcast.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; ); ```  with  ```java HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); // or if you already started an instance named \&quot;instance1\&quot; // HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.getHazelcastInstanceByName( \&quot;instance1\&quot; ); Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; ); ``` - **Removal of lite members:** With 3.0 there will be no member type as lite member. As 3.0 clients are smart client that they know in which node the data is located, you can replace your lite members with native clients.  - **Renaming \&quot;instance\&quot; to \&quot;distributed object\&quot;:** Before 3.0 there was a confusion for the term \&quot;instance\&quot;. It was used for both the cluster members and the distributed objects (map, queue, topic, etc. instances). Starting 3.0, the term instance will be only used for Hazelcast instances, namely cluster members. We will use the term \&quot;distributed object\&quot; for map, queue, etc. instances. So you should replace the related methods with the new renamed ones. As 3.0 clients are smart client that they know in which node the data is located, you can replace your lite members with native clients.  ```java public static void main( String[] args ) throws InterruptedException {   HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;test\&quot; );   Collection&lt;Instance&gt; instances = hazelcastInstance.getInstances();   for ( Instance instance : instances ) {     if ( instance.getInstanceType() == Instance.InstanceType.MAP ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;There is a map with name: \&quot; + instance.getId() );     }   } } ```  with  ```java public static void main( String[] args ) throws InterruptedException {   HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   IMap map = hz.getMap( \&quot;test\&quot; );   Collection&lt;DistributedObject&gt; objects = hazelcastInstance.getDistributedObjects();   for ( DistributedObject distributedObject : objects ) {     if ( distributedObject instanceof IMap ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;There is a map with name: \&quot; + distributedObject.getName() );     }   } } ```  - **Package structure change:** PartitionService has been moved to package `com.hazelcast.core` from `com.hazelcast.partition`.   - **Listener API change:** Before 3.0, `removeListener` methods was taking the Listener object as parameter. But, it causes confusion as same listener object may be used as parameter for different listener registrations. So we have changed the listener API. `addListener` methods return you an unique ID and you can remove listener by using this ID. So you should do following replacement if needed:  ```java IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;map\&quot; ); map.addEntryListener( listener, true ); map.removeEntryListener( listener ); ```      with 	 ```java IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;map\&quot; ); String listenerId = map.addEntryListener( listener, true ); map.removeEntryListener( listenerId ); ```  - **IMap changes:** - `tryRemove(K key, long timeout, TimeUnit timeunit)` returns boolean indicating whether operation is successful. - `tryLockAndGet(K key, long time, TimeUnit timeunit)` is removed. - `putAndUnlock(K key, V value)` is removed. - `lockMap(long time, TimeUnit timeunit)` and `unlockMap()` are removed. - `getMapEntry(K key)` is renamed as `getEntryView(K key)`. The returned object's type, MapEntry class is renamed as EntryView. - There is no predefined names for merge policies. You just give the full class name of the merge policy implementation.  ```xml &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy&lt;/merge-policy&gt; ```  Also MergePolicy interface has been renamed to MapMergePolicy and also returning null from the implemented `merge()` method causes the existing entry to be removed.  - **IQueue changes:** There is no change on IQueue API but there are changes on how `IQueue` is configured. With Hazelcast 3.0 there will not be backing map configuration for queue. Settings like backup count will be directly configured on queue config. For queue configuration details, please see the [Queue section](#queue). - **Transaction API change:** In Hazelcast 3.0, transaction API is completely different. Please see the [Transactions chapter](#transactions). - **ExecutorService API change:** Classes MultiTask and DistributedTask have been removed. All the functionality is supported by the newly presented interface IExecutorService. Please see the [Executor Service section](#executor-service). - **LifeCycleService API:** The lifecycle has been simplified. `pause()`, `resume()`, `restart()` methods have been removed. - **AtomicNumber:** `AtomicNumber` class has been renamed to `IAtomicLong`. - **ICountDownLatch:** `await()` operation has been removed. We expect users to use `await()` method with timeout parameters. - **ISemaphore API:** The `ISemaphore` has been substantially changed. `attach()`, `detach()` methods have been removed. - In 2.x releases, the default value for `max-size` eviction policy was **cluster_wide_map_size**. In 3.x releases, default is **PER_NODE**. After upgrading, the `max-size` should be set according to this new default, if it is not changed. Otherwise, it is likely that OutOfMemory exception may be thrown.           "

This behavior has been changed with the release of Hazelcast 3.5. `SpringAware` annotations are disabled by default.

    body: "## Starting the Member and Client  Having installed Hazelcast, you can get started.   In this short tutorial, you perform the following activities.  1. Create a simple Java application using the Hazelcast distributed map and queue.  2. Run our application twice to have a cluster with two members (JVMs).  3. Connect to our cluster from another Java application by using the Hazelcast Native Java Client API.  Let's begin.   - The following code starts the first Hazelcast member and creates and uses the `customers` map and queue.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;  import java.util.Map; import java.util.Queue;  public class GettingStarted {   public static void main( String[] args ) {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );     customers.put( 1, \&quot;Joe\&quot; );     customers.put( 2, \&quot;Ali\&quot; );     customers.put( 3, \&quot;Avi\&quot; );      System.out.println( \&quot;Customer with key 1: \&quot; + customers.get(1) );     System.out.println( \&quot;Map Size:\&quot; + customers.size() );      Queue&lt;String&gt; queueCustomers = hazelcastInstance.getQueue( \&quot;customers\&quot; );     queueCustomers.offer( \&quot;Tom\&quot; );     queueCustomers.offer( \&quot;Mary\&quot; );     queueCustomers.offer( \&quot;Jane\&quot; );     System.out.println( \&quot;First customer: \&quot; + queueCustomers.poll() );     System.out.println( \&quot;Second customer: \&quot;+ queueCustomers.peek() );     System.out.println( \&quot;Queue size: \&quot; + queueCustomers.size() );   } } ```  - Run this `GettingStarted` class a second time to get the second member  started. The members form a cluster and the output is similar to the following.  ``` Members [2] {   Member [127.0.0.1:5701]   Member [127.0.0.1:5702] this }                               ```  - Now, add the `hazelcast-client-`*`&lt;version&gt;`*`.jar` library to your classpath.  This is required to use a Hazelcast client.  - The following code starts a Hazelcast Client, connects to our cluster,  and prints the size of the `customers` map.  ```java     package com.hazelcast.test;  import com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig; import com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.IMap;  public class GettingStartedClient {     public static void main( String[] args ) {         ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();         HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient( clientConfig );         IMap map = client.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );         System.out.println( \&quot;Map Size:\&quot; + map.size() );     } } ``` - When you run it, you see the client properly connecting to the cluster  and printing the map size as **3**.  Hazelcast also offers a tool, **Management Center**, that enables you to monitor your cluster.  To use it, deploy the `mancenter-`*`&lt;version&gt;`*`.war` included in the ZIP file to your web server.  You can use it to monitor your maps, queues, and other distributed data structures and members. Please  see the [Management Center section](#management-center) for usage explanations.   By default, Hazelcast uses Multicast to discover other members that can form a cluster.  If you are  working with other Hazelcast developers on the same network, you may find yourself joining their  clusters under the default settings.  Hazelcast provides a way to segregate clusters within the same  network when using Multicast. Please see the [Creating Cluster Groups](#creating-cluster-groups)  for more information.  Alternatively, if you do not wish to use the default Multicast mechanism,  you can provide a fixed list of IP addresses that are allowed to join. Please see  the [Join Configuration section](#join) for more information. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;  ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *You can also check the video tutorials [here](http://hazelcast.org/getting-started/).* &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;      "

    body: "## Configuring Hazelcast  When Hazelcast starts up, it checks for the configuration as follows:  -	First, it looks for the `hazelcast.config` system property. If it is set, its value is used as the path. This is useful if you want to be able to change your Hazelcast configuration: you can do this because it is not embedded within the application. You can set the `config` option with the following command:   	`- Dhazelcast.config=`*`&lt;path to the hazelcast.xml&gt;`*. 	 	The path can be a normal one or a classpath reference with the prefix `CLASSPATH`. -	If the above system property is not set, Hazelcast then checks whether there is a `hazelcast.xml` file in the working directory. -	If not, then it checks whether `hazelcast.xml` exists on the classpath. -	If none of the above works, Hazelcast loads the default configuration, i.e. `hazelcast-default.xml` that comes with `hazelcast.jar`.    When you download and unzip `hazelcast-&lt;`*version*`&gt;.zip`, you will see a `hazelcast.xml` in the `/bin` folder. This is the declarative configuration file for Hazelcast. Part of this XML file is shown below.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast xsi:schemaLocation=\&quot;http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config hazelcast-config-3.5.xsd\&quot;            xmlns=\&quot;http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config\&quot;            xmlns:xsi=\&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\&quot;&gt;     &lt;group&gt;         &lt;name&gt;dev&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;password&gt;dev-pass&lt;/password&gt;     &lt;/group&gt;     &lt;management-center enabled=\&quot;false\&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/mancenter&lt;/management-center&gt;     &lt;network&gt;         &lt;port auto-increment=\&quot;true\&quot; port-count=\&quot;100\&quot;&gt;5701&lt;/port&gt;         &lt;outbound-ports&gt;             &lt;!--             Allowed port range when connecting to other nodes.             0 or * means use system provided port.             --&gt;             &lt;ports&gt;0&lt;/ports&gt;         &lt;/outbound-ports&gt;         &lt;join&gt;             &lt;multicast enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;                 &lt;multicast-group&gt;224.2.2.3&lt;/multicast-group&gt;                 &lt;multicast-port&gt;54327&lt;/multicast-port&gt;             &lt;/multicast&gt;             &lt;tcp-ip enabled=\&quot;false\&quot;&gt; ```  For most users, default configuration should be fine. If not, you can tailor this XML file according to your needs by adding/removing/modifying properties.  Besides declarative configuration, you can configure your cluster programmatically. Just instantiate a `Config` object and add/remove/modify properties.  You can also use wildcards while configuring Hazelcast.

    body: "# Hazelcast Overview   Hazelcast is an open source In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG).  It provides elastically scalable distributed In-Memory computing, widely recognized as the fastest and most scalable approach to application performance. Hazelcast does this in open source. More importantly, Hazelcast makes distributed computing simple by offering distributed implementations of many developer friendly interfaces from Java such as Map, Queue, ExecutorService, Lock, and JCache. For example, the Map interface provides an In-Memory Key Value store which confers many of the advantages of NoSQL in terms of developer friendliness and developer productivity.  In addition to distributing data In-Memory, Hazelcast provides a convenient set of APIs to access the CPUs in your cluster for maximum processing speed. Hazelcast is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Since Hazelcast is delivered as a compact library (JAR) and since it has no external dependencies other than Java, it easily plugs into your software solution and provides distributed data structures and distributed computing utilities.  Hazelcast is highly scalable and available (100% operational, never failing). Distributed applications can use Hazelcast for distributed caching, synchronization, clustering, processing, pub/sub messaging, etc. Hazelcast is implemented in Java and has clients for Java, C/C++, .NET and REST. Hazelcast also speaks memcache protocol. It plugs into Hibernate and can easily be used with any existing database system.  If you are looking for In-Memory speed, elastic scalability, and the developer friendliness of NoSQL, Hazelcast is a great choice.  **Hazelcast is simple**  Hazelcast is written in Java with no other dependencies. It exposes the same API from the familiar Java util package, exposing the same interfaces. Just add `hazelcast.jar` to your classpath, and you can quickly enjoy JVMs clustering and you can start building scalable applications.  **Hazelcast is Peer-to-Peer**  Unlike many NoSQL solutions, Hazelcast is peer-to-peer. There is no master and slave; there is no single point of failure. All nodes store equal amounts of data and do equal amounts of processing. You can embed Hazelcast in your existing application or use it in client and server mode where your application is a client to Hazelcast nodes.  **Hazelcast is scalable**  Hazelcast is designed to scale up to hundreds and thousands of nodes. Simply add new nodes and they will automatically discover the cluster and will linearly increase both memory and processing capacity. The nodes maintain a TCP connection between each other and all communication is performed through this layer.  **Hazelcast is fast**  Hazelcast stores everything in-memory. It is designed to perform very fast reads and updates.  **Hazelcast is redundant**  Hazelcast keeps the backup of each data entry on multiple nodes. On a node failure, the data is restored from the backup and the cluster will continue to operate without downtime.      "

    title: "Why Hazelcast?",
    body: "## Why Hazelcast?    **A Glance at Traditional Data Persistence**  Data is at the core of software systems. In conventional architectures, a relational database persists and provides access to data. Applications are talking directly with a database which has its backup as another machine. To increase performance, tuning or a faster machine is required. This can cost a large amount of money or effort.  There is also the idea of keeping copies of data next to the database, which is performed using technologies like external key-value stores or second level caching. This helps to offload the database. However, when the database is saturated or the applications perform mostly \&quot;put\&quot; operations (writes), this approach is of no use because it insulates the database only from the \&quot;get\&quot; loads (reads). Even if the applications are read-intensive, there can be consistency problems: when data changes, what happens to the cache, and how are the changes handled? This is when concepts like time-to-live (TTL) or write-through come in.  However, in the case of TTL, if the access is less frequent then the TTL, the result will always be a cache miss. On the other hand, in the case of write-through caches; if there are more than one of these caches in a cluster, then we again have consistency issues. This can be avoided by having the nodes communicating with each other so that entry invalidations can be propagated.  We can conclude that an ideal cache would combine TTL and write-through features. And, there are several cache servers and in-memory database solutions in this field. However, those are stand-alone single instances with a distribution mechanism to an extent provided by other technologies. This brings us back to square one: we would experience saturation or capacity issues if the product is a single instance or if consistency is not provided by the distribution.  **And, there is Hazelcast**  Hazelcast, a brand new approach to data, is designed around the concept of distribution. Hazelcast shares data around the cluster for flexibility and performance. It is an in-memory data grid for clustering and highly scalable data distribution.  One of the main features of Hazelcast is not having a master node. Each node in the cluster is configured to be the same in terms of functionality. The oldest node (the first node created in the node cluster) manages the cluster members, i.e. automatically performs the data assignment to nodes. If the oldest node dies, the second oldest node will manage the cluster members.  Another main feature is the data being held entirely in-memory. This is fast. In the case of a failure, such as a node crash, no data will be lost since Hazelcast distributes copies of data across all the nodes of cluster.  As shown in the feature list in the [Hazelcast Overview](#hazelcast-overview), Hazelcast supports a number of distributed data structures and distributed computing utilities. This provides powerful ways of accessing distributed clustered memory and accessing CPUs for true distributed computing.   **Hazelcast's Distinctive Strengths**   * It is open source. * It is a small JAR file. You do not need to install software. * It is a library, it does not impose an architecture on Hazelcast users. * It provides out of the box distributed data structures (i.e. Map, Queue, MultiMap, Topic, Lock, Executor, etc.). * There is no \&quot;master\&quot;, so no single point of failure in Hazelcast cluster; each node in the cluster is configured to be functionally the same. * When the size of your memory and compute requirement increases, new nodes can be dynamically joined to the cluster to scale elastically. * Data is resilient to node failure. Data backups are distributed across the cluster. This is a big benefit when a node in the cluster crashes: data will not be lost. * Nodes are always aware of each other: they communicate, unlike traditional key-value caching solutions. * You can build your own custom distributed data structures using the Service Programming Interface (SPI) if you are not happy with the data structures provided.  Finally, Hazelcast has a vibrant open source community enabling it to be continuously developed.  Hazelcast is a fit when you need:  -	analytic applications requiring big data processing by partitioning the data, -	to retain frequently accessed data in the grid, -	a cache, particularly an open source JCache provider with elastic distributed scalability, -	a primary data store for applications with utmost performance, scalability and low-latency requirements, -	an In-Memory NoSQL Key Value Store, -	publish/subscribe communication at highest speed and scalability between applications, -	applications that need to scale elastically in distributed and cloud environments, -	a highly available distributed cache for applications, -	an alternative to Coherence, Gemfire and Terracotta.

Partitions are memory segments, where each of those segments can contain hundreds or thousands of data entries, depending on the memory capacity of your system.   By default, Hazelcast offers 271 partitions. When you start a node, that nose owns those 271 partitions. The following illustration shows the partitions in a single node Hazelcast cluster.  ![](images/NodePartition.jpg)  When you start a second node on that cluster (creating a 2-node Hazelcast cluster), the partitions are distributed as shown in the following illustration.   ![](images/BackupPartitions.jpg)  In the illustration, the partitions with black text are primary partitions, and the partitions with blue text are replica partitions (backups). The first node has 135 primary partitions (black), and each of these partitions are backed up in the second node (blue). At the same time, the first node also has the replica partitions of the second node's primary partitions.  As you add more nodes, Hazelcast one-by-one moves some of the primary and replica partitions to the new nodes, making all nodes equal and redundant. Only the minimum amount of partitions will be moved to scale out Hazelcast. The following is an illustration of the partition distributions in a 4-node Hazelcast cluster.  ![](images/4NodeCluster.jpg)  Hazelcast distributes the partitions equally among the members of the cluster.

The ownerships may be changed when, for example, a new node joins the cluster, or when a node leaves the cluster.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If the oldest node goes down, the next oldest node sends the partition table information to the other nodes.*  You can configure the frequency (how often) that the node sends the partition table the information by using the `hazelcast.partition.table.send.interval` system property.

The cluster members do not need to know the concrete addresses of the other members, they just multicast to all the other members for listening. It depends on your environment if multicast is possible or allowed.  To set your Hazelcast to multicast auto-discovery, set the following configuration elements. Please refer to the [multicast element section](#multicast-element) for the full description of the multicast discovery configuration elements.  - Set the `enabled` attribute of the `multicast` element to \&quot;true\&quot;. - Set `multicast-group`, `multicast-port`, `multicast-time-to-live`, etc. to your multicast values. - Set the `enabled` attribute of both `tcp-ip` and `aws` elements to \&quot;false\&quot;.

This only applies to the startup of nodes where no leader has been assigned yet. If you specify a high value to `multicast-timeout-seconds`, such as 60 seconds, it means that until a leader is selected, each node will wait 60 seconds before moving on. Be careful when providing a high value. Also be careful not to set the value too low, or the nodes might give up too early and create their own cluster.         "

When you configure Hazelcast to discover members by TCP/IP, you must list all or a subset of the members' hostnames and/or IP addresses as cluster members. You do not have to list all of these cluster members, but at least one of the listed members has to be active in the cluster when a new member joins.  To set your Hazelcast to be a full TCP/IP cluster, set the following configuration elements. Please refer to the [tcp-ip element section](#tcp-ip-element) for the full description of the TCP/IP discovery configuration elements.  - Set the `enabled` attribute of the `multicast` element to \&quot;false\&quot;. - Set the `enabled` attribute of the `aws` element to \&quot;false\&quot;. - Set the `enabled` attribute of the `tcp-ip` element to \&quot;true\&quot;. - Set your `member` elements within the `tcp-ip` element.

You can also give a range of IP addresses, such as `192.168.1.0-7`.

By default, Hazelcast binds to all local network interfaces to accept incoming traffic. You can change this behavior using the system property `hazelcast.socket.bind.any`. If you set this property to `false`, Hazelcast uses the interfaces specified in the `interfaces` element (please refer to the [Interfaces Configuration section](#interfaces)).

    body: "## Creating Cluster Groups  You can create cluster groups. To do this, use the `group` configuration element.   By specifying a group name and group password, you can separate your clusters in a simple way. Example groupings can be by *development*, *production*, *test*, *app*, etc. The following is an example declarative configuration.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;group&gt;     &lt;name&gt;app1&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;password&gt;app1-pass&lt;/password&gt;   &lt;/group&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  You can also define the cluster groups using the programmatic configuration. A JVM can host multiple Hazelcast instances. Each Hazelcast instance can only participate in one group. Each Hazelcast instance only joins to its own group, it does not mess with other groups. The following code example creates three separate Hazelcast instances: `h1` belongs to the `app1` cluster, while `h2` and `h3` belong to the `app2` cluster.  ```java Config configApp1 = new Config(); configApp1.getGroupConfig().setName( \&quot;app1\&quot; ).setPassword( \&quot;app1-pass\&quot; );  Config configApp2 = new Config(); configApp2.getGroupConfig().setName( \&quot;app2\&quot; ).setPassword( \&quot;app2-pass\&quot; );  HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( configApp1 ); HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( configApp2 ); HazelcastInstance h3 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( configApp2 ); ```      "

    title: "Distributed Data Structures",
    body: "# Distributed Data Structures  As mentioned in the [Overview section](#hazelcast-overview), Hazelcast offers distributed implementations of Java interfaces. Below is the Java interface list with links to each section in this manual.  - **Standard utility collections:**  	- [Map](#map): The distributed implementation of `java.util.Map` lets you read from and write to a Hazelcast map with methods like get and put. 	- [Queue](#queue): The distributed queue is an implementation of `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`. You can add an item in one machine and remove it from another one. 	- [RingBuffer](#ringbuffer): The distributed RingBuffer is implemented for reliable eventing system. 	- [Set](#set): The distributed and concurrent implementation of `java.util.Set`. It does not allow duplicate elements and does not preserve their order. 	- [List](#list): Very similar to Hazelcast List, except that it allows duplicate elements and preserves their order. 	- [MultiMap](#multimap): This is a specialized Hazelcast map. It is distributed, where multiple values under a single key can be stored. 	- [ReplicatedMap](#replicated-map): This does not partition data, i.e. it does not spread data to different cluster members. Instead, it replicates the data to all nodes. - **Topic**: Distributed mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers; this is also known as a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model. Please see the [Topic section](#topic) for more information. - **Concurrency utilities**: 	- [Lock](#lock): Distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock`. When you lock using Hazelcast Lock, the critical section that it guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster. 	- [Semaphore](#isemaphore): Distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`. When performing concurrent activities, semaphores offer permits to control the thread counts. 	- [AtomicLong](#iatomiclong): Distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong`. Most of AtomicLong's operations are available. However, these operations involve remote calls and hence their performances differ from AtomicLong, due to being distributed. 	- [AtomicReference](#iatomicreference): When you need to deal with a reference in a distributed environment, you can use Hazelcast AtomicReference. This is the distributed version of `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference`. 	- [IdGenerator](#idgenerator): You use Hazelcast IdGenerator to generate cluster-wide unique identifiers. ID generation occurs almost at the speed of `AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()`. 	- [CountdownLatch](#icountdownlatch): Distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch`. Hazelcast CountDownLatch is a gate keeper for concurrent activities, enabling the threads to wait for other threads to complete their operations.  Common Features of all Hazelcast Data Structures:   - If a member goes down, its backup replica (which holds the same data) will dynamically redistribute the data, including the ownership and locks on them, to the remaining live nodes. As a result, no data will be lost. - There is no single cluster master that can cause single point of failure. Every node in the cluster has equal rights and responsibilities. No single node is superior. There is no dependency on an external 'server' or 'master'.  Here is an example of how you can retrieve existing data structure instances (map, queue, set, lock, topic, etc.) and how you can listen for instance events, such as an instance being created or destroyed.  ```java import java.util.Collection; import com.hazelcast.config.Config; import com.hazelcast.core.*;  public class Sample implements DistributedObjectListener {   public static void main(String[] args) {     Sample sample = new Sample();      Config config = new Config();     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);     hazelcastInstance.addDistributedObjectListener(sample);      Collection&lt;DistributedObject&gt; distributedObjects = hazelcastInstance.getDistributedObjects();     for (DistributedObject distributedObject : distributedObjects) {       System.out.println(distributedObject.getName() + \&quot;,\&quot; + distributedObject.getId());     }   }    @Override   public void distributedObjectCreated(DistributedObjectEvent event) {     DistributedObject instance = event.getDistributedObject();     System.out.println(\&quot;Created \&quot; + instance.getName() + \&quot;,\&quot; + instance.getId());   }    @Override   public void distributedObjectDestroyed(DistributedObjectEvent event) {     DistributedObject instance = event.getDistributedObject();     System.out.println(\&quot;Destroyed \&quot; + instance.getName() + \&quot;,\&quot; + instance.getId());   } } ```       "

    title: "How Distributed Map Works",
    body: "#### How Distributed Map Works  Hazelcast will partition your map entries and almost evenly distribute onto all Hazelcast members. Each member carries approximately \&quot;(1/n `*` total-data) + backups\&quot;, **n** being the number of nodes in the cluster. For example, if you have a node with 1000 objects to be stored in the cluster, and then you start a second node, each node will both store 500 objects and back up the 500 objects in the other node.  Let's create a Hazelcast instance (node) and fill a map named `Capitals` with key-value pairs using the following code.  ```java public class FillMapMember {   public static void main( String[] args ) {      HazelcastInstance hzInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     Map&lt;String, String&gt; capitalcities = hzInstance.getMap( \&quot;capitals\&quot; );      capitalcities.put( \&quot;1\&quot;, \&quot;Tokyo\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;2\&quot;, \&quot;Paris” );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;3\&quot;, \&quot;Washington\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;4\&quot;, \&quot;Ankara\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;5\&quot;, \&quot;Brussels\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;6\&quot;, \&quot;Amsterdam\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;7\&quot;, \&quot;New Delhi\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;8\&quot;, \&quot;London\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;9\&quot;, \&quot;Berlin\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;10\&quot;, \&quot;Oslo\&quot; );     capitalcities.put( \&quot;11\&quot;, \&quot;Moscow\&quot; );     ...     ...     capitalcities.put( \&quot;120\&quot;, \&quot;Stockholm\&quot; )   } } ```  When you run this code, a node is created with a map whose entries are distributed across the node's partitions. See the below illustration. For now, this is a single node cluster.  ![](images/1Node.jpg)  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Please note that some of the partitions will not contain any data entries since we only have 120 objects and the partition count is 271 by default. This count is configurable and can be changed using the system property `hazelcast.partition.count`. Please see the [System Properties section](#system-properties).*  Now, let's create a second node by running the above code again. This will create a cluster with 2 nodes. This is also where backups of entries are created; remember the backup partitions mentioned in the [Hazelcast Overview section](#hazelcast-overview). The following illustration shows two nodes and how the data and its backup is distributed.  ![](images/2Nodes.jpg)  As you see, when a new member joins the cluster, it takes ownership and loads some of the data in the cluster. Eventually, it will carry almost \&quot;(1/n `*` total-data) + backups\&quot; of the data, reducing the load on other nodes.  `HazelcastInstance::getMap` returns an instance of `com.hazelcast.core.IMap` which extends  the `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` interface. Methods like  `ConcurrentMap.putIfAbsent(key,value)` and `ConcurrentMap.replace(key,value)` can be used  on the distributed map, as shown in the example below.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;  HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();  Customer getCustomer( String id ) {     ConcurrentMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );     Customer customer = customers.get( id );     if (customer == null) {         customer = new Customer( id );         customer = customers.putIfAbsent( id, customer );     }     return customer; }                 public boolean updateCustomer( Customer customer ) {     ConcurrentMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );     return ( customers.replace( customer.getId(), customer ) != null );             }                  public boolean removeCustomer( Customer customer ) {     ConcurrentMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );     return customers.remove( customer.getId(), customer );            } ```  All `ConcurrentMap` operations such as `put` and `remove` might wait if the key is locked by another thread in the local or remote JVM. But, they will eventually return with success. `ConcurrentMap` operations never throw a `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException`.

If you set it to 2, then a map entry will have its backup on two other nodes. You can set it to 0 if you do not want your entries to be backed up, e.g. if performance is more important than backing up. The maximum value for the backup count is 6.  Hazelcast supports both synchronous and asynchronous backups. By default, backup operations are synchronous and configured with `backup-count`. In this case, backup operations block operations until backups are successfully copied to backup nodes (or deleted from backup nodes in case of remove) and acknowledgements are received. Therefore, backups are updated before a `put` operation is completed. Sync backup operations have a blocking cost which may lead to latency issues.  "

Currently supported policies are LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used).  Map eviction works based on the size of a partition. For example, once you specify a size using the `PER_NODE` attribute for `max-size` (please see [Configuring Map Eviction](#configuring-map-eviction)), Hazelcast internally calculates the maximum size for every partition. Eviction process starts according to this calculated per-partition maximum size when you try to put an entry. Below section gives an example scenario.  "

This means you are at the eviction threshold since you set the `max-size` to 20000. When you try to put an entry:  1. Entry goes to the relevant partition. 2. Partition checks whether the eviction threshold is reached (`max-size`). 3. If reached, approximately 10 (100 * 10%) entries are evicted from that particular partition.  As a result of this eviction process, when you check the size of your map, it is ~19990 (20000 - ~10). After this eviction, subsequent put operations will not trigger the next eviction until the map size is again close to the `max-size`.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Above scenario is just an example to describe how the eviction process works.

If it is not 0, entries that are older than this time and not updated for this time are evicted automatically. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`. Default value is 0, which means infinite. If it is not 0, entries are evicted regardless of the set `eviction-policy`.   - `max-idle-seconds`: Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay idle in the map. Entries that are idle for more than this time are evicted automatically. An entry is idle if no `get`, `put` or `containsKey` is called. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`. Default value is 0, which means infinite. - `eviction-policy`: Valid values are described below. 	- NONE: Default policy. If set, no items will be evicted and the property `max-size` will be ignored.  You still can combine it with `time-to-live-seconds` and `max-idle-seconds`. 	- LRU: Least Recently Used. 	- LFU: Least Frequently Used.	  - `max-size`: Maximum size of the map. When maximum size is reached, the map is evicted based on the policy defined. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`. Default value is 0. If you want `max-size` to work, set the `eviction-policy` property to a value other than NONE. Its attributes are described below. 	- `PER_NODE`: Maximum number of map entries in each JVM. This is the default policy.	 	 		`&lt;max-size policy=\&quot;PER_NODE\&quot;&gt;5000&lt;/max-size&gt;` 		 	- `PER_PARTITION`: Maximum number of map entries within each partition. Storage size depends on the partition count in a JVM. This attribute should not be used often. Avoid using this attribute with a small cluster: if the cluster is small it will be hosting more partitions, and therefore map entries, than that of a larger cluster. Thus, for a small cluster, eviction of the entries will decrease performance (the number of entries is large). 	 		`&lt;max-size policy=\&quot;PER_PARTITION\&quot;&gt;27100&lt;/max-size&gt;`  	- `USED_HEAP_SIZE`: Maximum used heap size in megabytes for each JVM. 	 		`&lt;max-size policy=\&quot;USED_HEAP_SIZE\&quot;&gt;4096&lt;/max-size&gt;`  	- `USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE`: Maximum used heap size percentage for each JVM. If, for example, JVM is configured to have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries will be evicted when used heap size exceeds 100 MB. 	 		`&lt;max-size policy=\&quot;USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE\&quot;&gt;10&lt;/max-size&gt;`  	- `FREE_HEAP_SIZE`: Minimum free heap size in megabytes for each JVM.  		`&lt;max-size policy=\&quot;FREE_HEAP_SIZE\&quot;&gt;512&lt;/max-size&gt;`  	- `FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE`: Minimum free heap size percentage for each JVM. If, for example, JVM is configured to have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries will be evicted when free heap size is below 100 MB.  		`&lt;max-size policy=\&quot;FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE\&quot;&gt;10&lt;/max-size&gt;`  - `eviction-percentage`: When `max-size` is reached, the specified percentage of the map will be evicted. For example, if set to 25, 25% of the entries will be evicted. Setting this property to a smaller value will cause eviction of a smaller number of map entries. Therefore, if map entries are inserted frequently, smaller percentage values may lead to overheads. Valid values are integers between 0 and 100. The default value is 25. - `min-eviction-check-millis`: The minimum time in milliseconds which should elapse before checking whether a partition of the map is evictable or not. In other terms, this property specifies the frequency of the eviction process. The default value is 100. Setting it to 0 (zero) makes the eviction process run for every put operation.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *When map entries are inserted frequently, the property `min-eviction-check-millis` should be set to a number lower than the insertion period in order not to let any entry escape from the eviction.*     "

    title: "In Memory Format",
    body: "### In Memory Format  IMap has an `in-memory-format` configuration option. By default, Hazelcast stores data into memory in binary (serialized) format. But sometimes, it can be efficient to store the entries in their object form, especially in cases of local processing like entry processor and queries. By setting `in-memory-format` in map's configuration, you can decide how the data will be stored in memory. You have the following format options.  - `BINARY` (default): This is the default option. The data will be stored in serialized binary format. You can use this option if you mostly perform regular map operations, such as `put` and `get`.  - `OBJECT`: The data will be stored in deserialized form. This configuration is good for maps where entry processing and queries form the majority of all operations and the objects are complex ones, making the serialization cost respectively high. By storing objects, entry processing will not contain the deserialization cost.   Regular operations like `get` rely on the object instance. When the `OBJECT` format is used and a `get` is performed, the map does not return the stored instance, but creates a clone. Therefore, this whole `get` operation includes a serialization first on the node owning the instance, and then a deserialization on the node calling the instance. When the `BINARY` format is used, only a deserialization is required; this is faster.  Similarly, a `put` operation is faster when the `BINARY` format is used. If the format was `OBJECT`, map would create a clone of the instance, and there would first a serialization and then deserialization. When BINARY is used, only a deserialization is needed.   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If a value is stored in `OBJECT` format, a change on a returned value does not affect the stored instance. In this case, the returned instance is not the actual one but a clone. Therefore, changes made on an object after it is returned will not reflect on the actual stored data. Similarly, when a value is written to a map and the value is stored in `OBJECT` format, it will be a copy of the `put` value. Therefore, changes made on the object after it is stored will not reflect on the stored data.*     "

To do this, you can use Hazelcast's `MapStore` and `MapLoader` interfaces.  When you provide a `MapLoader` implementation and request an entry (`IMap.get()`) that does not exist in memory, `MapLoader`'s `load` or `loadAll` methods will load that entry from the data store. This loaded entry is placed into the map and will stay there until it is removed or evicted.  When a `MapStore` implementation is provided, an entry is also put into a user defined data store.   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Data store needs to be a centralized system that is accessible from all Hazelcast Nodes.

This exception will be thrown to prevent uncontrolled grow of write-behind queues. You can set per node maximum capacity with `GroupProperty#MAP_WRITE_BEHIND_QUEUE_CAPACITY`.*   In this mode, when the `map.put(key,value)` call returns:  - In-Memory entry is updated. - In-Memory backup copies are successfully created on other JVMs (if `backup-count` is greater than 0). - The entry is marked as dirty so that after `write-delay-seconds`, it can be persisted with `MapStore.store(key,value)` call. - For fault tolerance dirty entries are stored in a queue on the primary member and also on a back-up member.  The same behavior goes for the `map.remove(key)`, the only difference is that  `MapStore.delete(key)` is called when the entry will be deleted.  If `MapStore` throws an exception, then Hazelcast tries to store the entry again. If the entry still cannot be stored, a log message is printed and the entry is re-queued.   For batch write operations, which are only allowed in write-behind mode, Hazelcast will call `MapStore.storeAll(map)` and `MapStore.deleteAll(collection)` to do all writes in a single call. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If a map entry is marked as dirty, i.e. it is waiting to be persisted to the `MapStore` in a write-behind scenario, the eviction process forces the entry to be stored.

But `MapStore` does not know which entries to store when there is one configuration applied to multiple maps. To overcome this, Hazelcast provides the `MapStoreFactory` interface.  Using the `MapStoreFactory` interface, `MapStore`s for each map can be created when a wildcard configuration is used. Sample code is shown below.  ```java Config config = new Config(); MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig( \&quot;*\&quot; ); MapStoreConfig mapStoreConfig = mapConfig.getMapStoreConfig(); mapStoreConfig.setFactoryImplementation( new MapStoreFactory&lt;Object, Object&gt;() {   @Override   public MapLoader&lt;Object, Object&gt; newMapStore( String mapName, Properties properties ) {     return null;   } }); ```  If the configuration implements the `MapLoaderLifecycleSupport` interface, then the user can initialize the `MapLoader` implementation with the given map name, configuration properties, and the Hazelcast instance. See the following example code.  ```java public interface MapLoaderLifecycleSupport {    /**    * Initializes this MapLoader implementation. Hazelcast will call    * this method when the map is first used on the    * HazelcastInstance. Implementation can    * initialize required resources for the implementing    * mapLoader such as reading a config file and/or creating    * database connection.    */   void init( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance, Properties properties, String mapName );    /**    * Hazelcast will call this method before shutting down.    * This method can be overridden to cleanup the resources    * held by this map loader implementation, such as closing the    * database connections etc.    */   void destroy(); } ```   "

    body: "#### Initialization On Startup  You can use the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` API to pre-populate the in-memory map when the map is first touched/used. If `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` returns NULL then nothing will be loaded. Your `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` implementation can return all or some of the keys. For example, you may select and return only the `hot` keys. `MapLoader.loadAllKeys` is the fastest way of pre-populating the map since Hazelcast will optimize the loading process by having each node loading its owned portion of the entries.  The `InitialLoadMode` configuration parameter in the class [`MapStoreConfig`](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/5f4f6a876e572f91431ad22f01ad5af9f5837f72/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/config/MapStoreConfig.java) has two values: `LAZY` and `EAGER`. If `InitialLoadMode` is set to `LAZY`, data is not loaded during the map creation. If it is set to `EAGER`, the whole data is loaded while the map is created and everything becomes ready to use. Also, if you add indices to your map with the [`MapIndexConfig`](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/da5cceee74e471e33f65f43f31d891c9741e31e3/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/config/MapIndexConfig.java) class or the [`addIndex`](#indexing) method, then `InitialLoadMode` is overridden and `MapStoreConfig` behaves as if `EAGER` mode is on.  Here is the `MapLoader` initialization flow:  1. When `getMap()` is first called from any node, initialization will start depending on the value of `InitialLoadMode`. If it is set to `EAGER`, initialization starts.  If it is set to `LAZY`, initialization does not start but data is loaded each time a partition loading completes. 2. Hazelcast will call `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` to get all your keys on one of the nodes. 3. That node will distribute keys to all other nodes in batches. 4. Each node will load values of all its owned keys by calling `MapLoader.loadAll(keys)`. 5. Each node puts its owned entries into the map by calling `IMap.putTransient(key,value)`.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If the load mode is `LAZY` and when the `clear()` method is called (which triggers `MapStore.deleteAll()`), Hazelcast will remove **ONLY** the loaded entries from your map and datastore. Since the whole data is not loaded for this case (`LAZY` mode), please note that there may be still entries in your datastore.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The return type of `loadAllKeys()` is changed from `Set` to `Iterable` with the release of Hazelcast 3.5.

Hazelcast iterates over the iterable and, while doing so, sends out the keys to their respective owner nodes. The `Iterator` obtained from `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` may also implement the `Closeable` interface in which case it is closed once the iteration is over.

You can do that by implementing the `PostProcessingMapStore` interface to put the modified object into the distributed map. That will cause an extra step of `Serialization`, so use it only when needed. (This explanation is only valid when using the `write-through` map store configuration.)

    body: "### Near Cache  Map entries in Hazelcast are partitioned across the cluster. Imagine that you are reading the key `k` so many times and `k` is owned by another member in your cluster. Each `map.get(k)` will be a remote operation, meaning lots of network trips. If you have a map that is read-mostly, then you should consider creating a near cache for the map so that reads can be much faster and consume less network traffic. All these benefits do not come free. When using near cache, you should consider the following issues:  - JVM will have to hold extra cached data so it will increase the memory consumption. - If invalidation is turned on and entries are updated frequently, then invalidations will be costly. - Near cache breaks the strong consistency guarantees; you might be reading stale data.  Near cache is highly recommended for the maps that are read-mostly. Here is a near cache configuration for a map:  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;map name=\&quot;my-read-mostly-map\&quot;&gt;     ...     &lt;near-cache&gt;       &lt;!--         Maximum size of the near cache.

Entries that are         older than &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt; will get automatically evicted from the near cache.         Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means infinite.

NONE is the default.

Result = \&quot; + map.get( key ).amount );     }      static class Value implements Serializable {         public int amount;     } } ```  The IMap lock will automatically be collected by the garbage collector when the lock is released and no other waiting conditions exist on the lock.  The IMap lock is reentrant, but it does not support fairness.  Another way to solve the race issue can be acquiring a predictable `Lock` object from Hazelcast. This way, every value in the map can be given a lock or you can create a stripe of locks.   "

It has a performance boost over pessimistic locking.  Pessimistic locking is good if there are lots of updates on the same key. It is more robust than optimistic locking from the perspective of data consistency. In Hazelcast, use `IExecutorService` to submit a task to a key owner, or to a member or members. This is the recommended way to perform task executions that use pessimistic or optimistic locking techniques. `IExecutorService` will have less network hops and less data over wire, and tasks will be executed very near to the data.

    body: "#### ABA Problem  The ABA problem occurs in environments when a shared resource is open to change by multiple threads. Even if one thread sees the same value for a particular key in consecutive reads, it does not mean nothing has changed between the reads. Another thread may come and change the value, do work, and change the value back, but the first thread can think that nothing has changed.  To prevent these kind of problems, one solution is to use a version number and to check it before any write to be sure that nothing has changed between consecutive reads. Although all the other fields will be equal, the version field will prevent objects from being seen as equal. This is the optimistic locking strategy, and it is used in environments which do not expect intensive concurrent changes on a specific key.  In Hazelcast, you can apply optimistic locking strategy with the map `replace` method. This method compares values in object or data forms depending on the in-memory format configuration. If the values are equal, it replaces the old value with the new one. If you want to use your defined `equals` method, in-memory format should be `Object`. Otherwise, Hazelcast serializes objects to binary forms and compares them.        "

An entry-based event is fired after the operations that affect a  specific entry: for example, `IMap#remove` or `IMap#evict`.   Let's take a look at the following code sample. To catch an event, you should explicitly  implement a corresponding sub-interface of a `MapListener`,  such as `EntryAddedListener` or `MapClearedListener`.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *`EntryListener` interface still can be implemented,  we kept that as is due to backward compatibility reasons.

You can change the returned value from a `get` operation, change the value to be `put` or `cancel` operations by throwing an exception.  Interceptors are different from listeners. With listeners, you take an action after the operation has been completed. Interceptor actions are synchronous and you can alter the behavior of operation, change the values, or totally cancel it.  Map interceptors are chained, so adding the same interceptor multiple times to the same map can result in duplicate effects. This can easily happen when the interceptor is added to the map at node initialization, so that each node adds the same interceptor. When adding the interceptor in this way, be sure that the `hashCode()` method is implemented to return the same value for every instance of the interceptor. It is not strictly necessary, but it is a good idea to also implement `equals()` as this will ensure that the map interceptor can be removed reliably.  IMap API has two methods for adding and removing an interceptor to the map,`addInterceptor` and `removeInterceptor`:  ```java /**  * Adds an interceptor for this map.

For example, on a 5 node cluster with 10 GB of data and 25 GB heap size per node, a single call of `IMap.entrySet()` fetches 50 GB of data and crashes the calling instance.  A call of `IMap.values()` may return too much data for a single node. This can also happen with a real query and an unlucky choice of predicates, especially when the parameters are chosen by a user of your application.  To prevent this, you can configure a maximum result size limit for query based operations. This is not a limit like `SELECT * FROM map LIMIT 100`, which you can achieve by a [Paging Predicate](#paging-predicate-order-limit). A maximum result size limit for query based operations is meant to be a last line of defense to prevent your nodes from retrieving more data than they can handle.

Let's put one integer on the queue every second, 100 integers total.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.IQueue;  public class ProducerMember {   public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {     HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     IQueue&lt;Integer&gt; queue = hz.getQueue( \&quot;queue\&quot; );     for ( int k = 1; k &lt; 100; k++ ) {       queue.put( k );       System.out.println( \&quot;Producing: \&quot; + k );       Thread.sleep(1000);     }     queue.put( -1 );     System.out.println( \&quot;Producer Finished!\&quot; );   } } ```   `Producer` puts a **-1** on the queue to show that the `put`'s are finished. Now, let's create a `Consumer` class that take a message from this queue, as shown below.   ```java import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.IQueue;  public class ConsumerMember {   public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {     HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     IQueue&lt;Integer&gt; queue = hz.getQueue( \&quot;queue\&quot; );     while ( true ) {       int item = queue.take();       System.out.println( \&quot;Consumed: \&quot; + item );       if ( item == -1 ) {         queue.put( -1 );         break;       }       Thread.sleep( 5000 );     }     System.out.println( \&quot;Consumer Finished!\&quot; );   } } ```  As seen in the above sample code, `Consumer` waits 5 seconds before it consumes the next message. It stops once it receives **-1**. Also note that `Consumer` puts **-1** back on the queue before the loop is ended.   When you first start `Producer` and then start `Consumer`, items produced on the queue will be consumed from the same queue.  From the above sample code, you can see that an item is produced every second, and consumed every 5 seconds. Therefore, the consumer keeps growing. To balance the produce/consume operation, let's start another consumer. By this way, consumption is distributed to these two consumers, as seen in the sample outputs below.   The second consumer is started. After a while, here is the first consumer output:  ```plain ... Consumed 13  Consumed 15 Consumer 17 ... ```  Here is the second consumer output:  ```plain ... Consumed 14  Consumed 16 Consumer 18 ... ```  In the case of a lot of producers and consumers for the queue, using a list of queues may solve the queue bottlenecks. In this case, be aware that the order of the messages being sent to different queues is not guaranteed. Since in most cases strict ordering is not important, a list of queues is a good solution.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The items are taken from the queue in the same order they were put on the queue. However, if there is more than one consumer, this order is not guaranteed.*    "

    title: "Bounded Queue",
    body: "### Bounded Queue  A bounded queue is a queue with a limited capacity. When the bounded queue is full, no more items can be put into the queue until some items are taken out.  A Hazelcast distributed queue can be turned into a bounded queue by setting the capacity limit using the `max-size` property.  Queue capacity can be set using the `max-size` property in the configuration, as shown below. `max-size` specifies the maximum size of the queue. Once the queue size reaches this value, `put` operations will be blocked until the queue size goes below `max-size`, that happens when a consumer removes items from the queue.  Let's set **10** as the maximum size of our sample queue in the Sample Queue Code.   ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;queue name=\&quot;queue\&quot;&gt;     &lt;max-size&gt;10&lt;/max-size&gt;   &lt;/queue&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  When the producer is started, 10 items are put into the queue and then the queue will not allow more `put` operations. When the consumer is started, it will remove items from the queue. This means that the producer can `put` more items into the queue until there are 10 items in the queue again, at which point `put` operation again become blocked.  But in this sample code, the producer is 5 times faster than the consumer. It will effectively always be waiting for the consumer to remove items before it can put more on the queue. For this sample code, if maximum throughput was the goal, it would be a good option to start multiple consumers to prevent the queue from filling up.       "

    title: "Queue Persistence",
    body: "### Queue Persistence   Hazelcast allows you to load and store the distributed queue items from/to a persistent datastore using the interface `QueueStore`. If queue store is enabled, each item added to the queue will also be stored at the configured queue store. When the number of items in the queue exceeds the memory limit, the subsequent items are persisted in the queue store, they are not stored in the queue memory.   `QueueStore` interface enables you to store, load, and delete items with methods like `store`, `storeAll`, `load` and `delete`. The following example class includes all of the `QueueStore` methods.  ```java public class TheQueueStore implements QueueStore&lt;Item&gt; {     @Override     public void delete(Long key) {         System.out.println(\&quot;delete\&quot;);     }      @Override     public void store(Long key, Item value) {         System.out.println(\&quot;store\&quot;);     }      @Override     public void storeAll(Map&lt;Long, Item&gt; map) {         System.out.println(\&quot;store all\&quot;);     }      @Override     public void deleteAll(Collection&lt;Long&gt; keys) {         System.out.println(\&quot;deleteAll\&quot;);     }      @Override     public Item load(Long key) {         System.out.println(\&quot;load\&quot;);         return null;     }      @Override     public Map&lt;Long, Item&gt; loadAll(Collection&lt;Long&gt; keys) {         System.out.println(\&quot;loadAll\&quot;);         return null;     }      @Override     public Set&lt;Long&gt; loadAllKeys() {         System.out.println(\&quot;loadAllKeys\&quot;);         return null;     } ```   `Item` must be serializable. Following is an example queue store configuration.   ```xml &lt;queue-store&gt;   &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.QueueStoreImpl&lt;/class-name&gt;   &lt;properties&gt;     &lt;property name=\&quot;binary\&quot;&gt;false&lt;/property&gt;     &lt;property name=\&quot;memory-limit\&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/property&gt;     &lt;property name=\&quot;bulk-load\&quot;&gt;500&lt;/property&gt;   &lt;/properties&gt; &lt;/queue-store&gt; ```  Let's explain the properties.  - **Binary**: By default, Hazelcast stores the queue items in serialized form in memory. Before it inserts the queue items into datastore, it deserializes them. But if you will not reach the queue store from an external application, you might prefer that the items be inserted in binary form. You can get rid of the de-serialization step; this would be a performance optimization. The binary feature is disabled by default.      - **Memory Limit**: This is the number of items after which Hazelcast will store items only to datastore. For example, if the memory limit is 1000, then the 1001st item will be put only to datastore. This feature is useful when you want to avoid out-of-memory conditions. The default number for `memory-limit` is 1000. If you want to always use memory, you can set it to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.      - **Bulk Load**: When the queue is initialized, items are loaded from `QueueStore` in bulks. Bulk load is the size of these bulks. By default, `bulk-load` is 250.      "

You can define the count of synchronous backups using the `backup-count` element in the declarative configuration. A queue can also have asynchronous backups, you can define the count using the `async-backup-count` element.   The `max-size` element defines the maximum size of the queue. You can use the `empty-queue-ttl` element when you want to purge unused or empty queues after a period of time.

You can reach each element in a Ringbuffer using a sequence ID, which is mapped to the elements between the head  and tail (inclusive) of the Ringbuffer.   Reading from Ringbuffer is very simple. Just get the current head and start reading. The method `readOne` returns the item at the  given sequence or blocks if no item is available. To read the next item, the sequence is incremented by one.  ```java Ringbuffer&lt;String&gt; ringbuffer = hz.getRingbuffer(\&quot;rb\&quot;); long sequence = ringbuffer.headSequence(); while(true){     String item = ringbuffer.readOne(sequence);     sequence++;     ... process item }   ```  By exposing the sequence, you can now move the item from Ringbuffer as long as the item is still available.

Adding an item to Ringbuffer is also very easy:  ```java Ringbuffer&lt;String&gt; ringbuffer = hz.getRingbuffer(\&quot;rb\&quot;); ringbuffer.add(\&quot;someitem\&quot;) ```  The method `add` returns the sequence of the inserted item and this value will always be unique.

Normally you could use an IQueue per thread for the same semantic, but this is  less efficient because of the increased remoting. A take from an IQueue is destructive, so the change needs to be applied for backup  also, which is why a `queue.take()` is more expensive than a `ringBuffer.read(...)`. * Reads are extremely cheap since there is no change in the Ringbuffer, therefore no replication is required.  * Reads and writes can be batched to speed up performance.

That is why the method `addAllAsync` is available.

That is why the method `readManyAsync` is available.  Please see the following example code.  ```java ICompletableFuture&lt;ReadResultSet&lt;E&gt;&gt; readManyAsync(    long startSequence,     int minCount,                                                  int maxCount,     IFunction&lt;E, Boolean&gt; filter); ```  This call can read a batch of items and can filter items at the source. The meaning of the arguments are given below.  * `startSequence`: Sequence of the first item to read. * `minCount`: Minimum number of items to read. If you do not want to block, set it to 0. If you do want to block for at least one item, set it to 1. * `maxCount`: Maximum number of the items to retrieve. Its value cannot exceed 1000. * `filter`: A function that accepts an item and checks if it should be returned. If no filtering should be applied, set it to null.  A full example is given below.  ```java long sequence = rb.headSequence(); for(;;) {     ICompletableFuture&lt;ReadResultSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; f = rb.readManyAsync(sequence, 1, 10, null);     ReadResultSet&lt;String&gt; rs = f.get();     for (String s : rs) {         System.out.println(s);     }     sequence+=rs.readCount(); } ```          Please take a careful look at how the sequence is being incremented.

    body: "### Internals  Each node has a list of all registrations in the cluster. When a new node is registered for a topic, it sends a registration message to all members in the cluster. Also, when a new node joins the cluster, it will receive all registrations made so far in the cluster.  The behavior of a topic varies depending on the value of the configuration parameter `globalOrderEnabled`.  - If `globalOrderEnabled` is disabled:   Messages are ordered, i.e. listeners (subscribers) process the messages in the order that the messages are published. If cluster member M publishes messages *m1, m2, m3, ..., mn* to a topic **T**, then Hazelcast makes sure that all of the subscribers of topic **T** will receive and process *m1, m2, m3, ..., mn* in the given order.  Here is how it works. Let's say that we have three nodes (*node1*, *node2* and *node3*) and that *node1* and *node2* are registered to a topic named `news`. Note that all three nodes know that *node1* and *node2* are registered to `news`. 	 In this example, *node1* publishes two messages: `a1` and `a2`, and *node3* publishes two messages: `c1` and `c2`. When *node1* and *node3* publish a message, they will check their local list for registered nodes, and they will discover that *node1* and *node2* are in their lists, then they will fire messages to those nodes. One possible order of the messages received can be the following.  *node1* -&gt; `c1`, `b1`, `a2`, `c2`  *node2* -&gt; `c1`, `c2`, `a1`, `a2`  - If `globalOrderEnabled` is enabled:   When enabled, `globalOrderEnabled` guarantees that all nodes listening to the same topic will get its messages in the same order.  Here is how it works. Let's say that we have three nodes (*node1*, *node2* and *node3*) and that *node1* and *node2* are registered to a topic named `news`. Note that all three nodes know that *node1* and *node2* are registered to `news`.  In this example, *node1* publishes two messages: `a1` and `a2`, and *node3* publishes two messages: `c1` and `c2`. When a node publishes messages over the topic `news`, it first calculates which partition the `news` ID corresponds to. Then it sends an operation to the owner of the partition for that node to publish messages. Let's assume that `news` corresponds to a partition that *node2* owns. *node1* and *node3* first sends all messages to *node2*. Assume that the messages are published in the following order:  *node1* -&gt; `a1`, `c1`, `a2`, `c2`  *node2* then publishes these messages by looking at registrations in its local list. It sends these messages to *node1* and *node2* (it makes a local dispatch for itself).  *node1* -&gt; `a1`, `c1`, `a2`, `c2`  *node2* -&gt; `a1`, `c1`, `a2`, `c2`  This way, we guarantee that all nodes will see the events in the same order.  In both cases, there is a `StripedExecutor` in EventService that is responsible for dispatching the received message. For all events in Hazelcast, the order that events are generated and the order they are published to the user are guaranteed to be the same via this `StripedExecutor`.  In `StripedExecutor`, there are as many threads as are specified in the property  `hazelcast.event.thread.count` (default is 5). For a specific event source (for a particular topic name), *hash of that source's name % 5* gives the ID of the responsible thread. Note that there can be another event source (entry listener of a map, item listener of a collection, etc.) corresponding to the same thread. In order not to make other messages to block, heavy processing should not be done in this thread. If there is time consuming work that needs to be done, the work should be handed over to another thread. Please see the [Sample Topic Code section](#sample-topic-code).     "

Meaning if you lock using an ILock, the critical section that it guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster. Even though locks are great for synchronization, they can lead to problems if not used properly. Also note that Hazelcast Lock does not support fairness.  A few warnings when using locks:  - Always use locks with *try*-*catch* blocks. It will ensure that locks will be released if an exception is thrown from the code in a critical section. Also note that the lock method is outside the *try*-*catch* block, because we do not want to unlock if the lock operation itself fails.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;  HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Lock lock = hazelcastInstance.getLock( \&quot;myLock\&quot; ); lock.lock(); try {   // do something here } finally {   lock.unlock(); } ```  - If a lock is not released in the cluster, another thread that is trying to get the lock can wait forever. To avoid this, use `tryLock` with a timeout value. You can set a high value (normally it should not take that long) for `tryLock`. You can check the return value of `tryLock` as follows:  ```java if ( lock.tryLock ( 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) ) {   try {       // do some stuff here..     } finally {       lock.unlock();     }    } else {   // warning } ```  - You can also avoid indefinitely waiting threads by using lock with lease time: the lock will be released in the given lease time. Lock can be safely unlocked before the lease time expires. Note that the unlock operation can throw an `IllegalMonitorStateException` if lock is released because the lease time expires. If that is the case, critical section guarantee is broken.  	Please see the below example.  ```java lock.lock( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) try {   // do some stuff here.. } finally {   try {     lock.unlock();   } catch ( IllegalMonitorStateException ex ){     // WARNING Critical section guarantee can be broken   } } ```  - Locks are fail-safe. If a member holds a lock and some other members go down, the cluster will keep your locks safe and available. Moreover, when a member leaves the cluster, all the locks acquired by that dead member will be removed so that those locks are immediately available for live members.   - Locks are re-entrant: the same thread can lock multiple times on the same lock. Note that for other threads to be  able to require this lock, the owner of the lock must call `unlock` as many times as the owner called `lock`.  - In the split-brain scenario, the cluster behaves as if it were two different clusters. Since two separate clusters are not aware of each other, two nodes from different clusters can acquire the same lock. For more information on places where split brain syndrome can be handled, please see [split brain syndrome](#network-partitioning-split-brain-syndrome).  - Locks are not automatically removed. If a lock is not used anymore, Hazelcast will not automatically garbage collect the lock.  This can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError`. If you create locks on the fly, make sure they are destroyed.  - Hazelcast IMap also provides locking support on the entry level with the method `IMap.lock(key)`. Although the same infrastructure  is used, `IMap.lock(key)` is not an ILock and it is not possible to expose it directly.       "

It offers most of AtomicLong's operations such as `get`, `set`, `getAndSet`, `compareAndSet` and `incrementAndGet`. Since IAtomicLong is a distributed implementation, these operations involve remote calls and hence their performances differ from AtomicLong.   The following sample code creates an instance, increments it by a million, and prints the count.  ```java public class Member {   public static void main( String[] args ) {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); 	     IAtomicLong counter = hazelcastInstance.getAtomicLong( \&quot;counter\&quot; );     for ( int k = 0; k &lt; 1000 * 1000; k++ ) { 	  if ( k % 500000 == 0 ) { 	    System.out.println( \&quot;At: \&quot; + k );       }       counter.incrementAndGet();     }     System.out.printf( \&quot;Count is %s\n\&quot;, counter.get() );   } } ```  When you start other instances with the code above, you will see the count as *member count* times *a million*.  You can send functions to an IAtomicLong. `Function` is a Hazelcast owned, single method interface. The following sample `Function` implementation doubles the original value.  ```java private static class Add2Function implements Function &lt;Long, Long&gt; {    @Override   public Long apply( Long input ) {      return input + 2;   } } ```  You can use the following methods to execute functions on IAtomicLong.  - `apply`: It applies the function to the value in IAtomicLong without changing the actual value and returning the result. - `alter`: It alters the value stored in the IAtomicLong by applying the function. It will not send back a result. - `alterAndGet`: It alters the value stored in the IAtomicLong by applying the function, storing the result in the IAtomicLong and returning the result. - `getAndAlter`: It alters the value stored in the IAtomicLong by applying the function and returning the original value.  The following sample code includes these methods.  ```java public class Member {   public static void main( String[] args ) {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); 		     IAtomicLong atomicLong = hazelcastInstance.getAtomicLong( \&quot;counter\&quot; );      atomicLong.set( 1 );     long result = atomicLong.apply( new Add2Function() ); 		     System.out.println( \&quot;apply.result: \&quot; + result); 		     System.out.println( \&quot;apply.value: \&quot; + atomicLong.get() );      atomicLong.set( 1 );     atomicLong.alter( new Add2Function() ); 			     System.out.println( \&quot;alter.value: \&quot; + atomicLong.get() );      atomicLong.set( 1 );     result = atomicLong.alterAndGet( new Add2Function() ); 		     System.out.println( \&quot;alterAndGet.result: \&quot; + result ); 		     System.out.println( \&quot;alterAndGet.value: \&quot; + atomicLong.get() );      atomicLong.set( 1 );     result = atomicLong.getAndAlter( new Add2Function() ); 		     System.out.println( \&quot;getAndAlter.result: \&quot; + result ); 		     System.out.println( \&quot;getAndAlter.value: \&quot; + atomicLong.get() );   } } ```  The reason for using a function instead of a simple code line like `atomicLong.set(atomicLong.get() + 2));` is that the IAtomicLong read and write operations are not atomic. Since `IAtomicLong` is a distributed implementation, those operations can be remote ones, which may lead to race problems. By using functions, the data is not pulled into the code, but the code is sent to the data. This makes it more scalable.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *IAtomicLong has 1 synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. Its backup count is not configurable.*       "

But unlike the locks, when semaphores are used, any thread can release the permit and semaphores can have multiple permits.*  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Hazelcast Semaphore does not support fairness.*  When a permit is acquired on ISemaphore:  -	if there are permits, the number of permits in the semaphore is decreased by one and the calling thread performs its activity. If there is contention, the longest waiting thread will acquire the permit before all other threads. -	if no permits are available, the calling thread blocks until a permit becomes available. When a timeout happens during this block, the thread is interrupted. In the case where the semaphore is destroyed, an `InstanceDestroyedException` is thrown.  The following sample code uses an `IAtomicLong` resource 1000 times, increments the resource when a thread starts to use it, and decrements it when the thread completes.  ```java public class SemaphoreMember {   public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception{     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();      ISemaphore semaphore = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore( \&quot;semaphore\&quot; );      IAtomicLong resource = hazelcastInstance.getAtomicLong( \&quot;resource\&quot; );      for ( int k = 0 ; k &lt; 1000 ; k++ ) {       System.out.println( \&quot;At iteration: \&quot; + k + \&quot;, Active Threads: \&quot; + resource.get() );       semaphore.acquire();       try {         resource.incrementAndGet();         Thread.sleep( 1000 );         resource.decrementAndGet();       } finally {          semaphore.release();       }     }     System.out.println(\&quot;Finished\&quot;);   } } ```  Let's limit the concurrent access to this resource by allowing at most 3 threads. You can configure it declaratively by setting the `initial-permits` property, as shown below.  ```xml &lt;semaphore name=\&quot;semaphore\&quot;&gt;    &lt;initial-permits&gt;3&lt;/initial-permits&gt; &lt;/semaphore&gt; ```  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If there is a shortage of permits while the semaphore is being created, value of this property can be set to a negative number.*  If you execute the above `SemaphoreMember` class 5 times, the output will be similar to the following:  `At iteration: 0, Active Threads: 1`  `At iteration: 1, Active Threads: 2`  `At iteration: 2, Active Threads: 3`  `At iteration: 3, Active Threads: 3`  `At iteration: 4, Active Threads: 3`  As can be seen, the maximum count of concurrent threads is equal or smaller than 3. If you remove the semaphore acquire/release statements in `SemaphoreMember`, you will see that there is no limitation on the number of concurrent usages.  Hazelcast also provides backup support for `ISemaphore`. When a member goes down, another member can take over the semaphore with the permit information (permits are automatically released when a member goes down). To enable this, configure synchronous or asynchronous backup with the properties `backup-count` and `async-backup-count`(by default, synchronous backup is already enabled).  A sample configuration is shown below.  ```xml &lt;semaphore name=\&quot;semaphore\&quot;&gt;   &lt;initial-permits&gt;3&lt;/initial-permits&gt;   &lt;backup-count&gt;1&lt;/backup-count&gt; &lt;/semaphore&gt; ```  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If high performance is more important (than not losing the permit information), you can disable the backups by setting `backup-count` to 0.*  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ***RELATED INFORMATION***   *Please refer to the [Semaphore Configuration section](#semaphore-configuration) for a full description of Hazelcast Distributed Semaphore configuration.*        "

    body: "## IAtomicReference  The `IAtomicLong` is very useful if you need to deal with a long, but in some cases you need to deal with a reference. That is why Hazelcast also supports the `IAtomicReference` which is the distributed version of the `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference`.  Here is an IAtomicReference example.  ```java public class Member {     public static void main(String[] args) {         Config config = new Config();          HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);          IAtomicReference&lt;String&gt; ref = hz.getAtomicReference(\&quot;reference\&quot;);         ref.set(\&quot;foo\&quot;);         System.out.println(ref.get());         System.exit(0);     }  } ```  When you execute the above example, you will see the following output.  `foo`  Just like `IAtomicLong`, `IAtomicReference` has methods that accept a 'function' as an argument, such as `alter`, `alterAndGet`, `getAndAlter` and `apply`. There are two big advantages of using these methods:  -	From a performance point of view, it is better to send the function to the data then the data to the function. Often the function is a lot smaller than the data and therefore cheaper to send over the line. Also the function only needs to be transferred once to the target machine, and the data needs to be transferred twice. -	You do not need to deal with concurrency control. If you would perform a load, transform, store, you could run into a data race since another thread might have updated the value you are about to overwrite.   There are some issues you need to know, described below.  -	`IAtomicReference` works based on the byte-content and not on the object-reference. If you use the `compareAndSet` method, do not change to original value because its serialized content will then be different.  It is also important to know that if you rely on Java serialization, sometimes (especially with hashmaps) the same object can result in different binary content. -	`IAtomicReference` will always have 1 synchronous backup. -	All methods returning an object will return a private copy. You can modify the private copy, but the rest of the world will be shielded from your changes. If you want these changes to be visible to the rest of the world, you need to write the change back to the `IAtomicReference`; but be careful with introducing a data-race.  -	The 'in memory format' of an `IAtomicReference` is `binary`. The receiving side does not need to have the class definition available, unless it needs to be deserialized on the other side (e.g. because a method like 'alter' is executed). This deserialization is done for every call that needs to have the object instead of the binary content, so be careful with expensive object graphs that need to be deserialized. -	If you have an object with many fields or an object graph, and you only need to calculate some information or need a subset of fields, you can use the `apply` method. With the `apply` method, the whole object does not need to be sent over the line, only the information that is relevant.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     "

    title: "ICountDownLatch",
    body: "## ICountDownLatch    Hazelcast `ICountDownLatch` is the distributed implementation of `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch`. As you may know, `CountDownLatch` is considered to be a gate keeper for concurrent activities. It enables the threads to wait for other threads to complete their operations.  The following code samples describe the mechanism of `ICountDownLatch`. Assume that there is a leader process and there are follower processes that will wait until the leader completes. Here is the leader:  ```java public class Leader {   public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     ICountDownLatch latch = hazelcastInstance.getCountDownLatch( \&quot;countDownLatch\&quot; );     System.out.println( \&quot;Starting\&quot; );     latch.trySetCount( 1 );     Thread.sleep( 30000 );     latch.countDown();     System.out.println( \&quot;Leader finished\&quot; );     latch.destroy();   } } ```  Since only a single step is needed to be completed as a sample, the above code initializes the latch with 1. Then, the code sleeps for a while to simulate a process and starts the countdown. Finally, it clears up the latch. Let's write a follower:   ```java public class Follower {   public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     ICountDownLatch latch = hazelcastInstance.getCountDownLatch( \&quot;countDownLatch\&quot; );     System.out.println( \&quot;Waiting\&quot; );     boolean success = latch.await( 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS );     System.out.println( \&quot;Complete: \&quot; + success );   } }  ```  The follower class above first retrieves `ICountDownLatch` and then calls the `await` method to enable the thread to listen for the latch. The method `await` has a timeout value as a parameter. This is useful when `countDown` method fails. To see `ICountDownLatch` in action, start the leader first and then start one or more followers. You will see that the followers will wait until the leader completes.  In a distributed environment, the counting down cluster member may go down. In this case, all listeners are notified immediately and automatically by Hazelcast. The state of the current process just before the failure should be verified and 'how to continue now' should be decided (e.g. restart all process operations, continue with the first failed process operation, throw an exception, etc.).  Although the `ICountDownLatch` is a very useful synchronization aid, you will probably not use it on a daily basis. Unlike Java’s implementation, Hazelcast’s `ICountDownLatch` count can be re-set after a countdown has finished but not during an active count.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *ICountDownLatch has 1 synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. Its backup count is not configurable. Also, the count cannot be re-set during an active count, it should be re-set after the countdown is finished.*       "

ID generation occurs almost at the speed of `AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()`. A group of 1 million identifiers is allocated for each cluster member. In the background, this allocation takes place with an `IAtomicLong` incremented by 1 million. Once a cluster member generates IDs (allocation is done), `IdGenerator` increments a local counter. If a cluster member uses all IDs in the group, it will get another 1 million IDs. By this way, only one time of network traffic is needed, meaning that 999,999 identifiers are generated in memory instead of over the network. This is fast.  Let's write a sample identifier generator.  ```java public class IdGeneratorExample {   public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception {     HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();     IdGenerator idGen = hazelcastInstance.getIdGenerator( \&quot;newId\&quot; );     while (true) {       Long id = idGen.newId();       System.err.println( \&quot;Id: \&quot; + id );       Thread.sleep( 1000 );     }   } } ```  Let's run the above code two times. The output will be similar to the following.  ```plain Members [1] {   Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 this } Id: 1 Id: 2 Id: 3 ```   ```plain Members [2] {   Member [127.0.0.1]:5701   Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 this } Id: 1000001 Id: 1000002 Id: 1000003 ```  You can see that the generated IDs are unique and counting upwards. If you see duplicated identifiers, it means your instances could not form a cluster.    ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Generated IDs are unique during the life cycle of the cluster. If the entire cluster is restarted, IDs start from 0 again or you can initialize to a value using the `init()` method of IdGenerator.*  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *IdGenerator has 1 synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups.

    body: "## Replicated Map  A replicated map is a weakly consistent, distributed key-value data structure provided by Hazelcast.  All other data structures are partitioned in design. A replicated map does not partition data (it does not spread data to different cluster members); instead, it replicates the data to all nodes.  This leads to higher memory consumption. However, a replicated map has faster read and write access since the data are available on all nodes and writes take place on local nodes, eventually being replicated to all other nodes.  Weak consistency compared to eventually consistency means that replication is done on a best efforts basis. Lost or missing updates are neither tracked nor resent. This kind of data structure is suitable for immutable objects, catalogue data, or idempotent calculable data (like HTML pages).  Replicated map nearly fully implements the `java.util.Map` interface, but it lacks the methods from `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` since there are no atomic guarantees to writes or reads.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import java.util.Collection; import java.util.Map;  HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getReplicatedMap(\&quot;customers\&quot;); customers.put( \&quot;1\&quot;, new Customer( \&quot;Joe\&quot;, \&quot;Smith\&quot; ) ); customers.put( \&quot;2\&quot;, new Customer( \&quot;Ali\&quot;, \&quot;Selam\&quot; ) ); customers.put( \&quot;3\&quot;, new Customer( \&quot;Avi\&quot;, \&quot;Noyan\&quot; ) );  Collection&lt;Customer&gt; colCustomers = customers.values(); for ( Customer customer : colCustomers ) {   // process customer } ```  `HazelcastInstance::getReplicatedMap` returns `com.hazelcast.core.ReplicatedMap` which, as stated above, extends the `java.util.Map` interface.

If you need a definite point in time to empty the map, you may want to consider using a lock around the `clear` operation.

A new proxy instance and storage will be created on the next retrieval of the Replicated Map using `HazelcastInstance::getReplicatedMap`. You will have to reallocate the Replicated Map in your code.

    title: "Technical Design",
    body: "### Technical Design  There are several technical design decisions for configurable behavior.  **Initial provisioning**  If a new member joins, there are two ways you can handle the initial provisioning that is executed to replicate all existing values to the new member.  First, you can have an async fill up, which does not block reads while the fill up operation is underway. That way, you have immediate access on the new member, but it will take time until all values are eventually accessible. Not yet replicated values are returned as non-existing (null). Write operations to already existing keys during this async phase can be lost, since the vector clock for an entry might not be initialized by another member yet, and it might be seen as an old update by other members.  Second, you can perform a synchronous initial fill up, which blocks every read or write access to the map until the fill up operation is finished. Use this way with caution since it might block your application from operating.  **Replication delay**  By default, the replication of values is delayed by 100 milliseconds when no current waiting replication is found. This collects multiple updates and minimizes the operations overhead on replication. A hard limit of 1000 replications is built into the system to prevent `OutOfMemory` situations where you put lots of data into the replicated map in a very short time. The delay is configurable. A value of \&quot;0\&quot; means immediate replication. You can configure the trade off between replication overhead and the time for the value to be replicated.  **Concurrency Level**  The concurrency level configuration defines the number of mutexes and segments inside the replicated map storage. A mutex/segment is chosen by calculating the `hashCode` of the key and using the module by the concurrency level. If multiple keys fall into the same mutex, they will wait for other mutex holders on the same mutex to finish their operation.  For a high amount of values, or for high contention on the mutexes, this value can be changed.     "

Please see the [In-Memory Format section](#in-memory-format-on-replicated-map). The default value is `BINARY`. - `concurrency-level`: Number of parallel mutexes to minimize the contention on the keys. The default value is 32, which is a good number for lots of applications. If higher contention is seen on writes to values inside the replicated map, this value can be adjusted according to the needs. - `replication-delay-millis`: Defines the period in milliseconds after a put is executed that the put value is replicated to other nodes. During this time, multiple puts can be operated and the values are cached up to be sent all at once. This increases the latency for eventual consistency, but it lowers the I/O operations. The default value is 100ms before a replication is operated. If `replication-delay-millis` is set to 0, no delay is used (not cached) and all values are replicated one by one. - `async-fillup`: Defines if the replicated map is available for reads before the initial replication is completed. The default value is `true`. If set to `false` (i.e. synchronous initial fill up), no exception will be thrown when the replicated map is not yet ready, but the call will block until it is finished. - `statistics-enabled`: If set to `true`, the statistics such as cache hits and misses are collected. The default value is `false`. - `entry-listener`: The value of this element is the full canonical classname of the `EntryListener` implementation.   - `entry-listener#include-value`: This attribute defines if the event will include the value or not. Sometimes the key is enough to react on an event. In those situations, setting this value to `false` will save a deserialization cycle. The default value is `true`.   - `entry-listener#local`: This attribute is not used for Replicated Map since listeners are always local.  "

    body: "### Partition Lost Listener  Hazelcast provides fault-tolerance by keeping multiple copies of your data. For each partition, one of your nodes become owner and some of the other nodes become replica nodes based on your configuration. Nevertheless, data loss may occur if a few nodes crash simultaneously.  Let`s consider the following example with three nodes: N1, N2, N3 for a given partition-0. N1 is owner of partition-0, N2 and N3 are the first and second replicas respectively. If N1 and N2 crash simultaneously, partition-0 loses its data that is configured with less than 2 backups. For instance, if we configure a map with 1 backup, that map loses its data in partition-0 since both owner and first replica of partition-0 have crashed. However, if we configure our map with 2 backups, it does not lose any data since a copy of partition-0's data for the given map also resides in N3.   The Partition Lost Listener notifies for possible data loss occurrences with the information of how many replicas are lost for a partition. It listens to `PartitionLostEvent` instances. Partition lost events are dispatched per partition.   Partition loss detection is done after a node crash is detected by the other nodes and the crashed node is removed from the cluster. Please note that false-positive `PartitionLostEvent` instances may be fired on partial network split errors.   The following is an example of Partition Lost Listener.   ```java     public class ConsoleLoggingPartitionLostListener implements PartitionLostListener {         @Override         public void partitionLost(PartitionLostEvent event) {             System.out.println(event);         }     }  ```  When a `PartitionLostEvent` is fired, the partition lost listener given above outputs the partition ID, the replica index that is lost and the node that has detected the partition loss.

This striped executor also guarantees the event order. For all events in Hazelcast, the order in which events are generated and the order in which they are published are guaranteed for given keys. For map and multimap, the order is preserved for the operations on the same key of the entry. For list, set, topic and queue, the order is preserved for events on that instance of the distributed data structure.  You achieve the order guarantee by making only one thread responsible for a particular set of events (entry events of a key in a map, item events of a collection, etc.) in `StripedExecutor`.  If the event queue reaches its capacity (`hazelcast.event.queue.capacity`) and the last item cannot be put into the event queue for the period specified in `hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis`, these events will be dropped with a warning message, such as \&quot;EventQueue overloaded\&quot;.  If event listeners perform a computation that takes a long time, the event queue can reach its maximum capacity and lose events. For map and multimap, you can configure `hazelcast.event.thread.count` to a higher value so that fewer collisions occur for keys, and therefore worker threads will not block each other in `StripedExecutor`. For list, set, topic and queue, you should offload heavy work to another thread. To preserve order guarantee, you should implement similar logic with `StripedExecutor` in the offloaded thread pool. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;   ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *Please refer to the [Listener Configurations section](#listener-configurations) on how to configure each listener.*      "

Hazelcast offers `IExecutorService` for you to use in distributed environments: it implements `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` to serve the applications requiring computational and data processing power.  With `IExecutorService`, you can execute tasks asynchronously and perform other useful tasks. If your task execution takes longer than expected, you can cancel the task execution. Tasks should be `Serializable` since they will be distributed.  In the Java Executor framework, you implement tasks two ways: Callable or Runnable.  * Callable: If you need to return a value and submit to Executor, implement the task as `java.util.concurrent.Callable`. * Runnable: If you do not need to return a value, implement the task as `java.util.concurrent.Runnable`.

In its call() method, it returns the local member and the input passed in. Remember that `instance.getCluster().getLocalMember()` returns the local member and `toString()` returns the member's address (IP + port) in String form, just to see which member actually executed the code for our example. Of course, the `call()` method can do and return anything you like.   ```java import java.util.concurrent.Callable; import java.io.Serializable;  public class Echo implements Callable&lt;String&gt;, Serializable {     String input = null;      public Echo() {     }      public Echo(String input) {         this.input = input;     }      public String call() {         Config cfg = new Config();         HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(cfg);         return instance.getCluster().getLocalMember().toString() + \&quot;:\&quot; + input;     } } ```  To execute a task with the executor framework:  * Obtain an `ExecutorService` instance (generally via `Executors`). * Submit a task which returns a `Future`.  * After executing the task, you do not have to wait for the execution to complete, you can process other things.  * When ready, use the `Future` object to retrieve the result as shown in the code example below.  Below, the Echo task is executed.  ```java ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); Future&lt;String&gt; future = executorService.submit( new Echo( \&quot;myinput\&quot;) ); //while it is executing, do some useful stuff //when ready, get the result of your execution String result = future.get(); ```  Please note that the Echo callable in the above code sample also implements a Serializable interface, since it may be sent to another JVM to be processed.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *When a task is deserialized, HazelcastInstance needs to be accessed.

However, please be aware of your JVM's capacity. If you think it cannot handle such an additional load caused by increasing the thread count, you may want to consider improving the JVM's resources (CPU, memory, etc.). As an example, set the `pool-size` to 5 and run the above `MasterMember`. You will see that `EchoTask` is run as soon as it is produced.   To scale out, more JVMs should be added instead of increasing only one JVM's capacity. In reality, you may want to expand your cluster by adding more physical or virtual machines. For example, in the EchoTask example in the [Runnable section](#runnable), you can create another Hazelcast instance.

    body: "### Execution Member Selection  As previously mentioned, it is possible to indicate where in the Hazelcast cluster the `Runnable` or `Callable` is executed. Usually, you will execute these in the cluster based on the location of a key, set of keys or just allow Hazelcast to select a member.  If want more control over where your code runs, you can use the `MemberSelector` interface. For example, you may want certain tasks to run only on certain members, or you may wish to implement some form of custom load balancing regime.  The `MemberSelector` is an interface that you can implement and then provide to the `IExecutorService` when you submit or execute.  The `select(Member)` method is called for every available member in the cluster and it is up to the implementation to decide if the member is going to be used or not.  In a simple example shown below, we select the cluster members based on the presence of an attribute.  ```java public class MyMemberSelector implements MemberSelector {      public boolean select(Member member) {          return Boolean.TRUE.equals(member.getAttribute(\&quot;my.special.executor\&quot;));      }  } ```     "

    body: "## Entry Processor  Hazelcast supports entry processing. An entry processor is a function that executes your code on a map entry in an atomic way.   An entry processor is a good option if you perform bulk processing on an `IMap`. Usually, you perform a loop of keys: executing `IMap.get(key)`, mutating the value, and finally putting the entry back in the map using `IMap.put(key,value)`.  If you perform this process from a client or from a member where the keys do not exist, you effectively perform 2 network hops for each update: the first to retrieve the data and the second to update the mutated value.  If you are doing the above, you should consider using entry processors. An entry processor executes a read and updates upon the member where the data resides.  This eliminates the costly network hops described previously.  "

It can be applied to a single map entry or to all map entries. It supports choosing target entries using predicates. You do not need any explicit lock on entry: Hazelcast locks the entry, runs the EntryProcessor, and then unlocks the entry.  Hazelcast sends the entry processor to each cluster member and these members apply it to map entries. Therefore, if you add more members, your processing is completed faster.  If entry processing is the major operation for a map and if the map consists of complex objects, you should use `OBJECT` as the `in-memory-format` to minimize serialization cost. By default, the entry value is stored as a byte array (`BINARY` format). When it is stored as an object (`OBJECT` format), then the entry processor is applied directly on the object. In that case, no serialization or deserialization is performed. But if there is a defined event listener, a new entry value will be serialized when passing to the event publisher service.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE***: *When `in-memory-format` is `OBJECT`, old value of the updated entry will be null.*  "

If you add new members to the cluster, the partition count for each member is reduced and hence the time spent by each member on iterating its entries is reduced. Therefore, the above querying approach is highly scalable. Another reason it is highly scalable is the pool of partition threads that evaluates the entries concurrently in each member. The network traffic is also reduced since only filtered data is sent to the requester.

Then a `PagingPredicate` is constructed in which the page size is 5, so there will be 5 objects in each page.  The first time the values are called creates the first page. You can get the subsequent pages by using the `nextPage()` method of `PagingPredicate` and querying the map again with the updated `PagingPredicate`.   ```java IMap&lt;Integer, Student&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;students\&quot; ); Predicate greaterEqual = Predicates.greaterEqual( \&quot;age\&quot;, 18 ); PagingPredicate pagingPredicate = new PagingPredicate( greaterEqual, 5 ); // Retrieve the first page Collection&lt;Student&gt; values = map.values( pagingPredicate ); ... // Set up next page pagingPredicate.nextPage(); // Retrieve next page values = map.values( pagingPredicate ); ... ```  If a comparator is not specified for `PagingPredicate`, but you want to get a collection of keys or values page by page, this collection must be an instance of `Comparable` (i.e. it must implement `java.lang.Comparable`).

When a query runs on a member, Hazelcast will iterate through the entire owned entries and find the matching ones. This can be made faster by indexing the mostly queried fields, just like you would do for your database. Indexing will add overhead for each `write` operation but queries will be a lot faster. If you query your map a lot, make sure to add indexes for the most frequently queried fields. For example, if your `active and age &lt; 30` query, make sure you add index for `active` and `age` fields. Here is how to do it.  ```java IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;employees\&quot; ); // ordered, since we have ranged queries for this field map.addIndex( \&quot;age\&quot;, true ); // not ordered, because boolean field cannot have range map.addIndex( \&quot;active\&quot;, false ); ```  `IMap.addIndex(fieldName, ordered)` is used for adding index. For each indexed field, if you have ranged queries such as `age&gt;30`, `age BETWEEN 40 AND 60`, then you should set the `ordered` parameter to `true`. Otherwise, set it to `false`.  Also, you can define `IMap` indexes in configuration. An example is shown below.  ```xml &lt;map name=\&quot;default\&quot;&gt;   ...   &lt;indexes&gt;     &lt;index ordered=\&quot;false\&quot;&gt;name&lt;/index&gt;     &lt;index ordered=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;age&lt;/index&gt;   &lt;/indexes&gt; &lt;/map&gt; ```  You can also define `IMap` indexes using programmatic configuration, as in the example below.  ```java mapConfig.addMapIndexConfig( new MapIndexConfig( \&quot;name\&quot;, false ) ); mapConfig.addMapIndexConfig( new MapIndexConfig( \&quot;age\&quot;, true ) ); ```  The following is the Spring declarative configuration for the same sample.  ```xml &lt;hz:map name=\&quot;default\&quot;&gt;   &lt;hz:indexes&gt;     &lt;hz:index attribute=\&quot;name\&quot;/&gt;     &lt;hz:index attribute=\&quot;age\&quot; ordered=\&quot;true\&quot;/&gt;   &lt;/hz:indexes&gt; &lt;/hz:map&gt; ``` &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Non-primitive types to be indexed should implement *`Comparable`*.*      "

With Hadoop as the most common and well known implementation, MapReduce gained a broad audience and made it into all kinds of business applications dominated by data warehouses.  MapReduce is a software framework for processing large amounts of data in a distributed way. Therefore, the processing is normally spread over several machines. The basic idea behind MapReduce is to map your source data into a collection of key-value pairs and reducing those pairs, grouped by key, in a second step towards the final result.  The main idea can be summarized with the following steps.    1. Read the source data.   2. Map the data to one or multiple key-value pairs.   3. Reduce all pairs with the same key.  **Use Cases**  The best known examples for MapReduce algorithms are text processing tools, such as counting the word frequency in large texts or websites. Apart from that, there are more interesting examples of use cases listed below.   - Log Analysis  - Data Querying  - Aggregation and summing  - Distributed Sort  - ETL (Extract Transform Load)  - Credit and Risk management  - Fraud detection  - and more...

From left to right, it iterates over all the entries of a data structure (in this case an IMap). In the mapping phase, it splits the sentence into single words and emits a key-value pair per word: the word is the key, 1 is the value. In the next phase, values are collected (grouped) and transported to their corresponding reducers, where they are eventually reduced to a single key-value pair, the value being the number of occurrences of the word. At the last step, the different reducer results are grouped up to the final result and returned to the requester.  ![](images/mapreduce/workflow.png)  In pseudo code, the corresponding map and reduce function would look like the following. A Hazelcast code example will be shown in the next section.  ```plain map( key:String, document:String ):Void -&gt;   for each w:word in document:     emit( w, 1 )  reduce( word:String, counts:List[Int] ):Int -&gt;   return sum( counts ) ```  "

    body: "#### MapReduce Phases  As seen in the workflow example, a MapReduce process consists of multiple phases. The original MapReduce pattern describes two phases (map, reduce) and one optional phase (combine). In Hazelcast, these phases are either only existing virtually to explain the data flow or are executed in parallel during the real operation while the general idea is still persisting.  (K x V)\* -&gt; (L x W)*  [(k*1*, v*1*), ..., (k*n*, v*n*)] -&gt; [(l*1*, w*1*), ..., (l*m*, w*m*)]  **Mapping Phase**  The mapping phase iterates all key-value pairs of any kind of legal input source. The mapper then analyzes the input pairs and emits zero or more new key-value pairs.  K x V -&gt; (L x W)*  (k, v) -&gt; [(l*1*, w*1*), ..., (l*n*, w*n*)]  **Combine Phase**  In the combine phase, multiple key-value pairs with the same key are collected and combined to an intermediate result before being send to the reducers. **Combine phase is also optional in Hazelcast, but is highly recommended to lower the traffic.**  In terms of the word count example, this can be explained using the sentences \&quot;Saturn is a planet but the Earth is a planet, too\&quot;. As shown above, we would send two key-value pairs (planet, 1). The registered combiner now collects those two pairs and combines them into an intermediate result of (planet, 2). Instead of two key-value pairs sent through the wire, there is now only one for the key \&quot;planet\&quot;.  The pseudo code for a combiner is similar to the reducer.  ```text combine( word:String, counts:List[Int] ):Void -&gt;   emit( word, sum( counts ) ) ```  **Grouping / Shuffling Phase**  The grouping or shuffling phase only exists virtually in Hazelcast since it is not a real phase; emitted key-value pairs with the same key are always transferred to the same reducer in the same job. They are grouped together, which is equivalent to the shuffling phase.  **Reducing Phase**  In the reducing phase, the collected intermediate key-value pairs are reduced by their keys to build the final by-key result. This value can be a sum of all the emitted values of the same key, an average value, or something completely different, depending on the use case.  Here is a reduced representation of this phase.  L x W\* -&gt; X*  (l, [w*1*, ..., w*n*]) -&gt; [x*1*, ..., x*n*]  **Producing the Final Result**  This is not a real MapReduce phase, but it is the final step in Hazelcast after all reducers are notified that reducing has finished. The original job initiator then requests all reduced results and builds the final result.   "

    body: "### Introduction to MapReduce API  This section explains the basics of the Hazelcast MapReduce framework. While walking through the different API classes, we will build the [word count example that was discussed earlier](#mapreduce-essentials) and create it step by step.  The Hazelcast API for MapReduce operations consists of a fluent DSL-like configuration syntax to build and submit jobs. `JobTracker` is the basic entry point to all MapReduce operations and is retrieved from `com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance` by calling `getJobTracker` and supplying the name of the required `JobTracker` configuration. The configuration for `JobTracker`s will be discussed later, for now we focus on the API itself. In addition, the complete submission part of the API is built to support a fully reactive way of programming.  To give an easy introduction to people used to Hadoop, we created the class names to be as familiar as possible to their counterparts on Hadoop. That means while most users will recognize a lot of similar sounding classes, the way to configure the jobs is more fluent due to the DSL-like styled API.  While building the example, we will go through as many options as possible, e.g. we create a specialized `JobTracker` configuration (at the end). Special `JobTracker` configuration is not required, because for all other Hazelcast features you can use \&quot;default\&quot; as the configuration name. However, special configurations offer better options to predict behavior of the framework execution.  The full example is available [here](http://github.com/noctarius/hz-map-reduce) as a ready to run Maven project.  "

The same Job can be submitted multiple times, no matter if it is executed in parallel or after the previous execution is finished.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *After retrieving the `JobTracker`, be aware that it should only be used with data structures derived from the same HazelcastInstance. Otherwise, you can get unexpected behavior.*  To retrieve a `JobTracker` from Hazelcast, we will start by using the \&quot;default\&quot; configuration for convenience reasons to show the basic way.  ```java import com.hazelcast.mapreduce.*;  JobTracker jobTracker = hazelcastInstance.getJobTracker( \&quot;default\&quot; ); ```  `JobTracker` is retrieved using the same kind of entry point as most other Hazelcast features. After building the cluster connection, you use the created HazelcastInstance to request the configured (or default) `JobTracker` from Hazelcast.  The next step will be to create a new `Job` and configure it to execute our first MapReduce request against cluster data.  #### Job  As mentioned in the [JobTracker section](#jobtracker), a Job is created using the retrieved `JobTracker` instance. A Job defines exactly one configuration of a MapReduce task. Mapper, combiner and reducers will be defined per job but since the Job instance is only a configuration, it is possible to be submitted multiple times, no matter if executions happening in parallel or one after the other.  A submitted job is always identified using a unique combination of the `JobTracker`'s name and a jobId generated on submit-time. The way for retrieving the jobId will be shown in one of the later sections.  To create a Job, a second class `com.hazelcast.mapreduce.KeyValueSource` is necessary. We will have a deeper look at the KeyValueSource class in the next section, for now it is enough to know that it is used to wrap any kind of data or data structure into a well defined set of key-value pairs.  Below example code is a direct follow up of the example of the [JobTracker section](#jobtracker) and reuses the already created HazelcastInstance and `JobTracker` instances.  We start by retrieving an instance of our data map and create the Job instance afterwards. Implementations used to configure the Job will be discussed while walking further through the API documentation, they are not yet discussed.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Since the Job class is highly dependent upon generics to support type safety, the generics change over time and may not be assignment compatible to old variable types. To make use of the full potential of the fluent API, we recommend you use fluent method chaining as shown in this example to prevent the need for too many variables.*  ```java IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;articles\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMap( map ); Job&lt;String, String&gt; job = jobTracker.newJob( source );  ICompletableFuture&lt;Map&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt; future = job     .mapper( new TokenizerMapper() )     .combiner( new WordCountCombinerFactory() )     .reducer( new WordCountReducerFactory() )     .submit();  // Attach a callback listener future.andThen( buildCallback() );  // Wait and retrieve the result Map&lt;String, Long&gt; result = future.get(); ```  As seen above, we create the Job instance and define a mapper, combiner, reducer and eventually submit the request to the cluster. The `submit` method returns an ICompletableFuture that can be used to attach our callbacks or just to wait for the result to be processed in a blocking fashion.  There are more options available for job configurations such as defining a general chunk size or on what keys the operation will operate.

    title: "KeyValueSource",
    body: "#### KeyValueSource  `KeyValueSource` is able to either wrap Hazelcast data structures (like IMap, MultiMap, IList, ISet) into key-value pair input sources, or build your own custom key-value input source. The latter option makes it possible to feed Hazelcast MapReduce with all kinds of data, such as just-in-time downloaded web page contents or data files. People familiar with Hadoop will recognize similarities with the Input class.  You can imagine a `KeyValueSource` as a bigger `java.util.Iterator` implementation. Whereas most methods are required to be implemented, the `getAllKeys` method is optional to implement. If implementation is able to gather all keys upfront, it should be implemented and `isAllKeysSupported` must return `true`. That way, Job configured KeyPredicates are able to evaluate keys upfront before sending them to the cluster. Otherwise, they are serialized and transferred as well, to be evaluated at execution time.  As shown in the example above, the abstract `KeyValueSource` class provides a number of static methods to easily wrap Hazelcast data structures into `KeyValueSource` implementations already provided by Hazelcast. The data structures' generics are inherited into the resulting `KeyValueSource` instance. For data structures like IList or ISet, the key type is always String. While mapping, the key is the data structure's name whereas the value type and value itself are inherited from the IList or ISet itself.  ```java // KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.IMap IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;my-map\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMap( map ); ```  ```java // KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.MultiMap MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; multiMap = hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( \&quot;my-multimap\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMultiMap( multiMap ); ```  ```java // KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.IList IList&lt;String&gt; list = hazelcastInstance.getList( \&quot;my-list\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromList( list ); ```  ```java // KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.ISet ISet&lt;String&gt; set = hazelcastInstance.getSet( \&quot;my-set\&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromSet( set ); ```  **PartitionIdAware**  The `com.hazelcast.mapreduce.PartitionIdAware` interface can be implemented by the `KeyValueSource` implementation if the underlying data set is aware of the Hazelcast partitioning schema (as it is for all internal data structures). If this interface is implemented, the same `KeyValueSource` instance is reused multiple times for all partitions on the cluster node. As a consequence, the `close` and `open` methods are also executed multiple times but once per partitionId.  "

    title: "Mapper",
    body: "#### Mapper  Using the `Mapper` interface, you will implement the mapping logic. Mappers can transform, split, calculate, aggregate data from data sources. In Hazelcast, it is also possible to integrate data from more than the KeyValueSource data source by implementing `com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstanceAware` and requesting additional maps, multimaps, list, sets.  The mappers `map` function is called once per available entry in the data structure. If you work on distributed data structures that operate in a partition based fashion, then multiple mappers work in parallel on the different cluster nodes, on the nodes' assigned partitions. Mappers then prepare and maybe transform the input key-value pair and emit zero or more key-value pairs for reducing phase.  For our word count example, we retrieve an input document (a text document) and we transform it by splitting the text into the available words. After that, as discussed in the [pseudo code](#mapreduce-workflow-example), we emit every single word with a key-value pair with the word as the key and 1 as the value.  A common implementation of that `Mapper` might look like the following example:  ```java public class TokenizerMapper implements Mapper&lt;String, String, String, Long&gt; {   private static final Long ONE = Long.valueOf( 1L );    @Override   public void map(String key, String document, Context&lt;String, Long&gt; context) {     StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer( document.toLowerCase() );     while ( tokenizer.hasMoreTokens() ) {       context.emit( tokenizer.nextToken(), ONE );     }   } } ```  The code splits the mapped texts into their tokens, iterates over the tokenizer as long as there are more tokens, and emits a pair per word. Note that we're not yet collecting multiple occurrences of the same word, we just fire every word on its own.  **LifecycleMapper / LifecycleMapperAdapter**  The LifecycleMapper interface or its adapter class LifecycleMapperAdapter can be used to make the Mapper implementation lifecycle aware. That means it will be notified when mapping of a partition or set of data begins and when the last entry was mapped.  Only special algorithms might need those additional lifecycle events to prepare, clean up, or emit additional values.  "

    title: "Combiner / CombinerFactory",
    body: "#### Combiner / CombinerFactory  As stated in the introduction, a Combiner is used to minimize traffic between the different cluster nodes when transmitting mapped values from mappers to the reducers. It does this by aggregating multiple values for the same emitted key. This is a fully optional operation, but using it is highly recommended.  Combiners can be seen as an intermediate reducer. The calculated value is always assigned back to the key for which the combiner initially was created. Since combiners are created per emitted key, the Combiner implementation itself is not defined in the jobs configuration; instead, a CombinerFactory is created that is able to create the expected Combiner instance.  Because Hazelcast MapReduce is executing mapping and reducing phase in parallel, the Combiner implementation must be able to deal with chunked data. Therefore, you must reset its internal state whenever you call `finalizeChunk`. Calling that method creates a chunk of intermediate data to be grouped (shuffled) and sent to the reducers.  Combiners can override `beginCombine` and `finalizeCombine` to perform preparation or cleanup work.  For our word count example, we are going to have a simple CombinerFactory and Combiner implementation similar to the following example.  ```java public class WordCountCombinerFactory     implements CombinerFactory&lt;String, Long, Long&gt; {    @Override   public Combiner&lt;Long, Long&gt; newCombiner( String key ) {     return new WordCountCombiner();   }    private class WordCountCombiner extends Combiner&lt;Long, Long&gt; {     private long sum = 0;      @Override     public void combine( Long value ) {       sum++;     }      @Override     public Long finalizeChunk() {       return sum;     }              @Override     public void reset() {       sum = 0;     }   } } ```  The Combiner must be able to return its current value as a chunk and reset the internal state by setting `sum` back to 0. Since combiners are always called from a single thread, no synchronization or volatility of the variables is necessary.  "

    body: "#### Reducer / ReducerFactory  Reducers do the last bit of algorithm work. This can be aggregating values, calculating averages, or any other work that is expected from the algorithm.  Since values arrive in chunks, the `reduce` method is called multiple times for every emitted value of the creation key. This also can happen multiple times per chunk if no Combiner implementation was configured for a job configuration.  In difference of the combiners, a reducers `finalizeReduce` method is only called once per reducer (which means once per key). Therefore, a reducer does not need to reset its internal state at any time.  Reducers can override `beginReduce` to perform preparation work.  For our word count example, the implementation will look similar to the following code example.  ```java public class WordCountReducerFactory implements ReducerFactory&lt;String, Long, Long&gt; {    @Override   public Reducer&lt;Long, Long&gt; newReducer( String key ) {     return new WordCountReducer();   }    private class WordCountReducer extends Reducer&lt;Long, Long&gt; {     private volatile long sum = 0;      @Override     public void reduce( Long value ) {       sum += value.longValue();     }      @Override     public Long finalizeReduce() {       return sum;     }   } } ```  Different from combiners, reducers tend to switch threads if running out of data to prevent blocking threads from the `JobTracker` configuration. They are rescheduled at a later point when new data to be processed arrives but unlikely to be executed on the same thread as before. As of Hazelcast version 3.3.3 the guarantee for memory visibility on the new thread is ensured by the framework. This means the previous requirement for making fields volatile is dropped.  "

Only special use cases are likely to use collators.  For an imaginary use case, we might want to know how many words were all over in the documents we analyzed. For this case, a Collator implementation can be given to the `submit` method of the Job instance.  A collator would look like the following snippet:  ```java public class WordCountCollator implements Collator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;, Long&gt; {    @Override   public Long collate( Iterable&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt; values ) {     long sum = 0;      for ( Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt; entry : values ) {       sum += entry.getValue().longValue();     }     return sum;   } } ```  The definition of the input type is a bit strange, but because Combiner and Reducer implementations are optional, the input type heavily depends on the state of the data.

We will discuss the configuration properties one by one:  ```xml &lt;jobtracker name=\&quot;default\&quot;&gt;   &lt;max-thread-size&gt;0&lt;/max-thread-size&gt;   &lt;!-- Queue size 0 means number of partitions * 2 --&gt;   &lt;queue-size&gt;0&lt;/queue-size&gt;   &lt;retry-count&gt;0&lt;/retry-count&gt;   &lt;chunk-size&gt;1000&lt;/chunk-size&gt;   &lt;communicate-stats&gt;true&lt;/communicate-stats&gt;   &lt;topology-changed-strategy&gt;CANCEL_RUNNING_OPERATION&lt;/topology-changed-strategy&gt; &lt;/jobtracker&gt; ```  - **max-thread-size:** Configures the maximum thread pool size of the JobTracker. - **queue-size:** Defines the maximum number of tasks that are able to wait to be processed. A value of 0 means an unbounded queue. Very low numbers can prevent successful execution since job might not be correctly scheduled or intermediate chunks might be lost. - **retry-count:** Currently not used. Reserved for later use where the framework will automatically try to restart / retry operations from an available save point. - **chunk-size:** Defines the number of emitted values before a chunk is sent to the reducers. If your emitted values are big or you want to better balance your work, you might want to change this to a lower or higher value. A value of 0 means immediate transmission, but remember that low values mean higher traffic costs. A very high value might cause an OutOfMemoryError to occur if the emitted values do not fit into heap memory before being sent to the reducers. To prevent this, you might want to use a combiner to pre-reduce values on mapping nodes. - **communicate-stats:** Defines if statistics (for example, statistics about processed entries) are transmitted to the job emitter. This can show progress to a user inside of an UI system, but it produces additional traffic. If not needed, you might want to deactivate this. - **topology-changed-strategy:** Defines how the MapReduce framework will react on topology changes while executing a job. Currently, only CANCEL_RUNNING_OPERATION is fully supported, which throws an exception to the job emitter (will throw a `com.hazelcast.mapreduce.TopologyChangedException`).   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ***RELATED INFORMATION***   *Please refer to the [MapReduce Jobtracker Configuration section](#mapreduce-jobtracker-configuration) for a full description of Hazelcast MapReduce JobTracker configuration (includes an example programmatic configuration).*        "

    title: "Node Interoperation Example",
    body: "#### Node Interoperation Example  To understand the following technical internals, we first have a short look at what happens in terms of an example workflow.  As a simple example, think of an `IMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;` and emitted keys having the same types. Imagine you have a three node cluster and you initiate the MapReduce job on the first node. After you requested the JobTracker from your running / connected Hazelcast, we submit the task and retrieve the ICompletableFuture which gives us a chance to wait for the result to be calculated or to add a callback (and being more reactive).  The example expects that the chunk size is 0 or 1, so an emitted value is directly sent to the reducers. Internally, the job is prepared, started, and executed on all nodes as shown below. The first node acts as the job owner (job emitter).  ```plain Node1 starts MapReduce job Node1 emits key=Foo, value=1 Node1 does PartitionService::getKeyOwner(Foo) =&gt; results in Node3  Node2 emits key=Foo, value=14 Node2 asks jobOwner (Node1) for keyOwner of Foo =&gt; results in Node3  Node1 sends chunk for key=Foo to Node3  Node3 receives chunk for key=Foo and looks if there is already a Reducer,       if not creates one for key=Foo Node3 processes chunk for key=Foo  Node2 sends chunk for key=Foo to Node3  Node3 receives chunk for key=Foo and looks if there is already a Reducer and uses       the previous one Node3 processes chunk for key=Foo  Node1 send LastChunk information to Node3 because processing local values finished  Node2 emits key=Foo, value=27 Node2 has cached keyOwner of Foo =&gt; results in Node3 Node2 sends chunk for key=Foo to Node3  Node3 receives chunk for key=Foo and looks if there is already a Reducer and uses       the previous one Node3 processes chunk for key=Foo  Node2 send LastChunk information to Node3 because processing local values finished  Node3 finishes reducing for key=Foo  Node1 registers its local partitions are processed Node2 registers its local partitions are processed  Node1 sees all partitions processed and requests reducing from all nodes  Node1 merges all reduced results together in a final structure and returns it ```  The flow is quite complex but extremely powerful since everything is executed in parallel. Reducers do not wait until all values are emitted, but they immediately begin to reduce (when first chunk for an emitted key arrives).  "

    title: "MapReduce Job Walk-Through",
    body: "#### MapReduce Job Walk-Through  And now to the technical walk-through: a MapReduce Job is always retrieved from a named `JobTracker`, which is implemented in `NodeJobTracker` (extends `AbstractJobTracker`) and is configured using the configuration DSL. All of the internal implementation is completely ICompletableFuture-driven and mostly non-blocking in design.  On submit, the Job creates a unique UUID which afterwards acts as a jobId and is combined with the JobTracker's name to be uniquely identifiable inside the cluster. Then, the preparation is sent around the cluster and every member prepares its execution by creating a JobSupervisor, MapCombineTask, and ReducerTask. The job-emitting JobSupervisor gains special capabilities to synchronize and control JobSupervisors on other nodes for the same job.  If preparation is finished on all nodes, the job itself is started by executing a StartProcessingJobOperation on every node. This initiates a MappingPhase implementation (defaults to KeyValueSourceMappingPhase) and starts the actual mapping on the nodes.  The mapping process is currently a single threaded operation per node, but will be extended to run in parallel on multiple partitions (configurable per Job) in future versions. The Mapper is now called on every available value on the partition and eventually emits values. For every emitted value, either a configured CombinerFactory is called to create a Combiner or a cached one is used (or the default CollectingCombinerFactory is used to create Combiners). When the chunk limit is reached on a node, a IntermediateChunkNotification is prepared by collecting emitted keys to their corresponding nodes. This is either done by asking the job owner to assign members or by an already cached assignment. In later versions, a PartitionStrategy might also be configurable.  The IntermediateChunkNotification is then sent to the reducers (containing only values for this node) and is offered to the ReducerTask. On every offer, the ReducerTask checks if it is already running and if not, it submits itself to the configured ExecutorService (from the JobTracker configuration).  If reducer queue runs out of work, the ReducerTask is removed from the ExecutorService to not block threads but eventually will be resubmitted on next chunk of work.  On every phase, the partition state is changed to keep track of the currently running operations. A JobPartitionState can be in one of the following states with self-explanatory titles: `[WAITING, MAPPING, REDUCING, PROCESSED, CANCELLED]`. If you have a deeper interest of these states, look at the Javadoc.  - Node asks for new partition to process: WAITING =&gt; MAPPING - Node emits first chunk to a reducer: MAPPING =&gt; REDUCING - All nodes signal that they finished mapping phase and reducing is finished, too: REDUCING =&gt; PROCESSED  Eventually (or hopefully), all JobPartitionStates reach the state of PROCESSED. Then, the job emitter's JobSupervisor asks all nodes for their reduced results and executes a potentially offered Collator. With this Collator, the overall result is calculated before it removes itself from the JobTracker, doing some final cleanup and returning the result to the requester (using the internal TrackableJobFuture).  If a job is cancelled while execution, all partitions are immediately set to the CANCELLED state and a CancelJobSupervisorOperation is executed on all nodes to kill the running processes.  While the operation is running in addition to the default operations, some more operations like ProcessStatsUpdateOperation (updates processed records statistics) or NotifyRemoteExceptionOperation (notifies the nodes that the sending node encountered an unrecoverable situation and the Job needs to be cancelled - e.g. NullPointerException inside of a Mapper) are executed against the job owner to keep track of the process.

    body: "### Aggregations Basics  This section will quickly guide you through the basics of the Aggregations framework and some of its available classes. We also will implement a first base example.  Aggregations are available on both types of map interfaces, `com.hazelcast.core.IMap` and `com.hazelcast .core.MultiMap`, using the `aggregate` methods. Two overloaded methods are available that customize resource management of the underlying MapReduce framework by supplying a custom configured  `com.hazelcast.mapreduce.JobTracker` instance. To find out how to configure the MapReduce framework, please see the [JobTracker Configuration section](#jobtracker-configuration). We will later see another way to configure the automatically used MapReduce framework if no special `JobTracker` is supplied.  To make Aggregations more convenient to use and future proof, the API is heavily optimized for Java 8 and future versions. The API is still fully compatible with any Java version Hazelcast supports (Java 6 and Java 7). The biggest difference is how you work with the Java generics: on Java 6 and 7, the process to resolve generics is not as strong as on Java 8 and upcoming Java versions. In addition, the whole Aggregations API has full Java 8 Project Lambda (or Closure,  [JSR 335](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=335)) support.  For illustration of the differences in Java 6 and 7 in comparison to Java 8, we will have a quick look at code examples for both. After that, we will focus on using Java 8 syntax to keep examples short and easy to understand, and we will see some hints as to what the code looks like in Java 6 or 7.  The first example will produce the sum of some `int` values stored in a Hazelcast IMap. This example does not use much of the functionality of the Aggregations framework, but it will show the main difference.  ```java IMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; personAgeMapping = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;person-age\&quot; ); for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++ ) {   String lastName = RandomUtil.randomLastName();   int age = RandomUtil.randomAgeBetween( 20, 80 );   personAgeMapping.put( lastName, Integer.valueOf( age ) ); } ```  With our demo data prepared, we can see how to produce the sums in different Java versions.

For filtering data sets, you have two different options by default.

The `Supplier` abstract class has just one method. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Due to a limitation of the Java Lambda API, you cannot implement abstract classes using Lambdas. Instead it is recommended that you create a standard named class.*   ```java class MyCustomSupplier extends Supplier&lt;String, Integer, String&gt; {   public String apply( Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; entry ) {     Integer value = entry.getValue();     if (value == null) {       return null;     }     return value % 4 == 0 ? String.valueOf( value ) : null;   } } ```  `Supplier`s are expected to return null from the `apply` method whenever the input value should not be mapped to the aggregation process. This can be used, as in the example above, to implement filter rules directly. Implementing filters using the `KeyPredicate` and `Predicate` interfaces might be more convenient.  To use your own `Supplier`, just pass it to the aggregate method or use it in combination with other `Supplier`s.  ```java int sum = personAgeMapping.aggregate( new MyCustomSupplier(), Aggregations.count() ); ```  ```java Supplier&lt;String, Integer, String&gt; supplier =     Supplier.fromKeyPredicate(         lastName -&gt; \&quot;Jones\&quot;.equalsIgnoreCase( lastName ),         new MyCustomSupplier()      ); int sum = personAgeMapping.aggregate( supplier, Aggregations.count() ); ```  "

If no specific `JobTracker` was passed for the aggregation call, internally one will be created using the following naming specifications:  For `IMap` aggregation calls the naming specification is created as:  - `hz::aggregation-map-` and the concatenated name of the map.  For `MultiMap` it is very similar:  - `hz::aggregation-multimap-` and the concatenated name of the MultiMap.  Knowing that (the specification of the name), we can configure the `JobTracker` as expected  (as described in the [Jobtracker section](#jobtracker)) using the naming spec we just learned. For more information on configuration of the  `JobTracker`, please see the [JobTracker Configuration section](#jobtracker-configuration).

Let's have a look at our data model:  ```java class Employee implements Serializable {   private String firstName;   private String lastName;   private String companyName;   private String address;   private String city;   private String county;   private String state;   private int zip;   private String phone1;   private String phone2;   private String email;   private String web;    // getters and setters }  class SalaryMonth implements Serializable {   private Month month;   private int salary;      // getters and setters }  class SalaryYear implements Serializable {   private String email;   private int year;   private List&lt;SalaryMonth&gt; months;      // getters and setters      public int getAnnualSalary() {     int sum = 0;     for ( SalaryMonth salaryMonth : getMonths() ) {       sum += salaryMonth.getSalary();     }     return sum;   } } ```  The two `IMap`s and the `MultiMap` are keyed by the string of email. They are defined as follows:  ```java IMap&lt;String, Employee&gt; employees = hz.getMap( \&quot;employees\&quot; ); IMap&lt;String, SalaryYear&gt; salaries = hz.getMap( \&quot;salaries\&quot; ); MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; officeAssignment = hz.getMultiMap( \&quot;office-employee\&quot; ); ```  So far, we know all the important information to work out some example aggregations. We will look into some deeper implementation details and how we can work around some current limitations that will be eliminated in future versions of the API.  Let's start with a very basic example. We want to know the average salary of all of our employees. To do this, we need a `PropertyExtractor` and the average aggregation for type `Integer`.  ```java IMap&lt;String, SalaryYear&gt; salaries = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;salaries\&quot; ); PropertyExtractor&lt;SalaryYear, Integer&gt; extractor =     (salaryYear) -&gt; salaryYear.getAnnualSalary(); int avgSalary = salaries.aggregate( Supplier.all( extractor ),                                     Aggregations.integerAvg() ); ```  That's it. Internally, we created a MapReduce task based on the predefined aggregation and fired it up immediately. Currently, all aggregation calls are blocking operations, so it is not yet possible to execute the aggregation in a reactive way (using `com.hazelcast.core.ICompletableFuture`) but this will be part of an upcoming version.

    title: "Map Join Example",
    body: "#### Map Join Example  The following example is a little more complex. We only want to have our US based employees selected into the average salary calculation, so we need to execute some kind of a join operation between the employees and salaries maps.  ```java class USEmployeeFilter implements KeyPredicate&lt;String&gt;, HazelcastInstanceAware {   private transient HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;      public void setHazelcastInstance( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance ) {     this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance;   }      public boolean evaluate( String email ) {     IMap&lt;String, Employee&gt; employees = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;employees\&quot; );     Employee employee = employees.get( email );     return \&quot;US\&quot;.equals( employee.getCountry() );   } } ```  Using the `HazelcastInstanceAware` interface, we get the current instance of Hazelcast injected into our filter and we can perform data joins on other data structures of the cluster. We now only select employees that work as part of our US offices into the aggregation.  ```java IMap&lt;String, SalaryYear&gt; salaries = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;salaries\&quot; ); PropertyExtractor&lt;SalaryYear, Integer&gt; extractor =     (salaryYear) -&gt; salaryYear.getAnnualSalary(); int avgSalary = salaries.aggregate( Supplier.fromKeyPredicate(                                         new USEmployeeFilter(), extractor                                     ), Aggregations.integerAvg() ); ```  "

Currently, a group aggregator is not yet  available, so we need a small workaround to achieve this goal. (In later versions of the Aggregations API this will not be  required because it will be available out of the box in a much more convenient way.)  Again, let's start with our filter. This time, we want to filter based on an office name and we need to do some data joins to achieve this kind of filtering.   **A short tip:** to minimize the data transmission on the aggregation we can use [Data Affinity](#data-affinity) rules to influence the partitioning of data. Be aware that this is an expert feature of Hazelcast.  ```java class OfficeEmployeeFilter implements KeyPredicate&lt;String&gt;, HazelcastInstanceAware {   private transient HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;   private String office;      // Deserialization Constructor   public OfficeEmployeeFilter() {   }       public OfficeEmployeeFilter( String office ) {     this.office = office;   }      public void setHazelcastInstance( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance ) {     this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance;   }      public boolean evaluate( String email ) {     MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; officeAssignment = hazelcastInstance         .getMultiMap( \&quot;office-employee\&quot; );      return officeAssignment.containsEntry( office, email );       } } ```  Now we can execute our aggregations. As mentioned before, we currently need to do the grouping on our own by executing multiple aggregations in a row.  ```java Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; avgSalariesPerOffice = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();  IMap&lt;String, SalaryYear&gt; salaries = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;salaries\&quot; ); MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; officeAssignment =     hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( \&quot;office-employee\&quot; );  PropertyExtractor&lt;SalaryYear, Integer&gt; extractor =     (salaryYear) -&gt; salaryYear.getAnnualSalary();  for ( String office : officeAssignment.keySet() ) {   OfficeEmployeeFilter filter = new OfficeEmployeeFilter( office );   int avgSalary = salaries.aggregate( Supplier.fromKeyPredicate( filter, extractor ),                                       Aggregations.integerAvg() );                                          avgSalariesPerOffice.put( office, avgSalary ); } ```  "

It is meant to be an advanced section, so if you do not intend to implement your own aggregation, you might want to stop reading here and come back later when you need to know how to implement your own aggregation.  The main interface for making your own aggregation is `com.hazelcast.mapreduce.aggregation.Aggregation`. It consists of four methods.   ```java interface Aggregation&lt;Key, Supplied, Result&gt; {   Mapper getMapper(Supplier&lt;Key, ?, Supplied&gt; supplier);   CombinerFactory getCombinerFactory();   ReducerFactory getReducerFactory();   Collator&lt;Map.Entry, Result&gt; getCollator(); } ```   An `Aggregation` implementation is just defining a MapReduce task with a small difference: the `Mapper` is always expected to work on a `Supplier` that filters and / or transforms the mapped input value to some output value.  `getMapper` and `getReducerFactory` are expected to return non-null values. `getCombinerFactory` and `getCollator` are optional operations and do not need to be implemented. If you can decide to implement them depending on the use case you want to achieve.  For more information on how you implement mappers, combiners, reducers, and collators, refer to the [MapReduce section](#mapreduce).  For best speed and traffic usage, as mentioned in the [MapReduce section](#mapreduce), you should add a `Combiner` to your aggregation whenever it is possible to do some kind of pre-reduction step.  Your implementation also should use `DataSerializable` or `IdentifiedDataSerializable` for best compatibility and speed / stream-size reasons.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;       "

Please see the [Map Listener section](#map-listener) for information on how to add entry listeners to a map.  As an example, let's listen to the changes made on an employee with the surname \&quot;Smith\&quot;. First, let's create the `Employee` class.  ```java import java.io.Serializable;  public class Employee implements Serializable {      private final String surname;      public Employee(String surname) {         this.surname = surname;     }      @Override     public String toString() {         return \&quot;Employee{\&quot; +                 \&quot;surname='\&quot; + surname + '\'' +                 '}';     } } ```  Then, let's create the continuous query by adding the entry listener with the `surname` predicate.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.*; import com.hazelcast.query.SqlPredicate;  public class ContinuousQuery {      public static void main(String[] args) {         HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();         IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hz.getMap(\&quot;map\&quot;);         map.addEntryListener(new MyEntryListener(),                 new SqlPredicate(\&quot;surname=smith\&quot;), true);         System.out.println(\&quot;Entry Listener registered\&quot;);     }      static class MyEntryListener             implements EntryListener&lt;String, String&gt; {         @Override         public void entryAdded(EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event) {             System.out.println(\&quot;Entry Added:\&quot; + event);         }          @Override         public void entryRemoved(EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event) {             System.out.println(\&quot;Entry Removed:\&quot; + event);         }          @Override         public void entryUpdated(EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event) {             System.out.println(\&quot;Entry Updated:\&quot; + event);         }          @Override         public void entryEvicted(EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event) {             System.out.println(\&quot;Entry Evicted:\&quot; + event);         }          @Override         public void mapEvicted(MapEvent event) {             System.out.println(\&quot;Map Evicted:\&quot; + event);          }     } } ```  And now, let's play with the employee \&quot;smith\&quot; and see how that employee will be listened to.  ```java import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.IMap;  public class Modify {      public static void main(String[] args) {         HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();         IMap&lt;String, Employee&gt; map = hz.getMap(\&quot;map\&quot;);          map.put(\&quot;1\&quot;, new Employee(\&quot;smith\&quot;));         map.put(\&quot;2\&quot;, new Employee(\&quot;jordan\&quot;));         System.out.println(\&quot;done\&quot;);         System.exit(0);     } } ```  When you first run the class `ContinuousQuery` and then run `Modify`, you will see output similar to the listing below.  ``` entryAdded:EntryEvent {Address[192.168.178.10]:5702} key=1,oldValue=null, value=Person{name= smith }, event=ADDED, by Member [192.168.178.10]:5702 ```  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;        "

After construction of a continuous query cache, all changes on underlying `IMap` is immediately reflected to this cache as a stream of events.

Enable/disable initial query run on the existing `IMap` data during construction of continuous query cache according to the supplied predicate via `QueryCacheConfig#setPopulate`. 2. Indexable and queryable. 3. Evictable. Note that continuous query cache has a default maximum capacity of 10000. If you need a not evictable one, you should configure the eviction via `QueryCacheConfig#setEvictionConfig`. 4. Listenable via `QueryCache#addEntryListener`. 5. Events on `IMap` are guaranteed to be reflected to this cache in the happening order. Note that this happening order is a partition order so you can only expect ordered events from the same partition. Any loss of event can be listened via `EventLostListener` and it can be recoverable with `QueryCache#tryRecover` method. If your buffer size on the node side is big enough, you can recover from a possible event loss scenario.  At the moment, setting the size of `QueryCacheConfig#setBufferSize` is the only option for recovery because the events which feed continuous query cache have no backups. Below snippet can be used for recovery case.       ```java                QueryCache queryCache = map.getQueryCache(\&quot;cache-name\&quot;, new SqlPredicate(\&quot;this &gt; 20\&quot;), true);        queryCache.addEntryListener(new EventLostListener() {            @Override            public void eventLost(EventLostEvent event) {                queryCache.tryRecover();            }        }, false);     ```     6. Event batching and coalescing. 7. Declarative and programmatic configuration 8. It can be populated with only keys of entries and subsequent values can be retrieved directly via `QueryCache#get` from the underlying `IMap`. This will help    to decrease initial population time if the values are very big in size.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;          "

Its lifecycle will be managed by Hazelcast.   `CounterService` should implement the interface `com.hazelcast.spi.ManagedService` as shown below.  ```java import com.hazelcast.spi.ManagedService; import com.hazelcast.spi.NodeEngine;  import java.util.Properties; import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap; import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;  public class CounterService implements ManagedService {     private NodeEngine nodeEngine;      @Override     public void init( NodeEngine nodeEngine, Properties properties ) {         System.out.println( \&quot;CounterService.init\&quot; );         this.nodeEngine = nodeEngine;     }      @Override     public void shutdown( boolean terminate ) {         System.out.println( \&quot;CounterService.shutdown\&quot; );     }      @Override     public void reset() {     }  } ```  As can be seen from the code, `CounterService` implements the following methods.   - `init`: This is called when `CounterService` is initialized. `NodeEngine` enables access to Hazelcast internals such as `HazelcastInstance` and `PartitionService`. Also, the object `Properties` will provide us with the ability to create our own properties. - `shutdown`: This is called when `CounterService` is shutdown. It cleans up the resources. - `reset`: This is called when cluster members are faced with the Split-Brain issue. This occurs when disconnected members that have created their own cluster are merged back into the main cluster. Services can also implement the `SplitBrainHandleService` to indicate that they can take part in the merge process. For `CounterService` we are going to implement as a no-op.        "

It should be a unique name (`CounterService` in our case) since it will be looked up when a remote call is made. Note that the value of this attribute will be sent at each request, and that a longer `name` value means more data (de)serialization. A good practice is to give an understandable name with the shortest possible length. - `class-name` is the class name of the service (`CounterService` in our case). The class should have a *no-arg* constructor. Otherwise, the object cannot be initialized.  Note that multicast is enabled as the join mechanism.

It does not include the counter state. Therefore, the method `inc` should be invoked on the cluster member hosting the real counter. You can invoke it using Hazelcast SPI; then it will send the operations to the correct member and return the results.  Let's dig deeper into the method `inc`.  - First, we create `IncOperation` with a given `name` and `amount`. - Then, we get the partition ID based on the `name`; by this way, all operations for a given name will result in the same partition ID. - Then, we create an `InvocationBuilder` where the connection between operation and partition is made. - Finally, we invoke the `InvocationBuilder` and wait for its result. This waiting is performed with a `future.get()`. In our case, timeout is not important. However, it is a good practice to use a timeout for a real system since operations should complete in a certain amount of time.   "

If it is an `InterruptedException`, we have two options: Either propagating the exception or just using the `ExceptionUtil.rethrow` for all exceptions. Please see below sample.   ```java   try {      final Future&lt;Integer&gt; future = invocation.invoke();      return future.get();   } catch(InterruptedException e){      throw e;   } catch(Exception e){      throw ExceptionUtil.rethrow(e);   } ```  "

Since `IncOperation` will return a response, the method `returnsResponse` returns `true`. If your method is asynchronous and does not need to return a response, it is better to return `false` since it will be faster. The actual response is stored in the field `returnValue`; you can retrieve it with the method `getResponse`.  There are two more methods in the above code: `writeInternal` and `readInternal`. Since `IncOperation` needs to be serialized, these two methods should be overwritten, and hence, `objectId` and `amount` will be serialized and available when those operations are executed.   For the deserialization, note that the operation must have a *no-arg* constructor.  "

    body: "### Creating Backups  Finally, we make sure that the data of counter is available on another node when a member goes down. We need to have the `IncOperation` class implement the `BackupAwareOperation` interface contained in the SPI package. See the following code.  ```java class IncOperation extends AbstractOperation  	implements PartitionAwareOperation, BackupAwareOperation {    ...           @Override    public int getAsyncBackupCount() {       return 0;    }     @Override    public int getSyncBackupCount() {       return 1;    }     @Override    public boolean shouldBackup() {       return true;    }     @Override    public Operation getBackupOperation() {       return new IncBackupOperation(objectId, amount);    } } ```  The methods `getAsyncBackupCount` and `getSyncBackupCount` specify the count for asynchronous and synchronous backups. Our sample has one synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. In the above code, counts of the backups are hard-coded, but they can also be passed to `IncOperation` as parameters.   The method `shouldBackup` specifies whether our Operation needs a backup or not. For our sample, it returns `true`, meaning the Operation will always have a backup even if there are no changes. Of course, in real systems, we want to have backups if there is a change. For `IncOperation` for example, having a backup when `amount` is null would be a good practice.  The method `getBackupOperation` returns the operation (`IncBackupOperation`) that actually performs the backup creation; the backup itself is an operation and will run on the same infrastructure.   If a backup should be made and `getSyncBackupCount` returns **3**, then three `IncBackupOperation` instances are created and sent to the three machines containing the backup partition. If fewer machines are available, then backups need to be created. Hazelcast will just send a smaller number of operations.   "

For each notify operation:  - it looks for a waiter, - it asks the waiter whether it wants to keep waiting, - if the waiter responds *no*, the service executes its registered operation (operation itself knows where to send a response), - it rinses and repeats until a waiter wants to keep waiting.   Each waiter can sit on a wait-notify queue for, at most, its operation's call timeout. For example, by default, each waiter can wait here for at most 1 minute. There is a continuous task that scans expired/timed-out waiters and invalidates them with `CallTimeoutException`. Each waiter on the remote side should retry and keep waiting if it still wants to wait. This is a liveness check for remote waiters.   This way, it is possible to distinguish an unresponsive node and a long (~infinite) wait. On the caller side, if the waiting thread does not get a response for either a call timeout or for more than *2 times the call-timeout*, it will exit with `OperationTimeoutException`.    Note that this behavior breaks the fairness. Hazelcast does not support fairness for any of the data structures with blocking operations (i.e. lock and semaphore).     "

    body: "## Transaction Interface  You create a `TransactionContext` to begin, commit, and rollback a transaction. You can obtain transaction-aware instances of queues, maps, sets, lists, multimaps via `TransactionContext`, work with them, and commit/rollback in one shot.  Hazelcast supports two types of transactions: LOCAL (One Phase) and TWO\_PHASE. With the type, you have influence over how much guarantee you get when a member crashes while a transaction is committing. The default behavior is TWO\_PHASE.  - **LOCAL**: Unlike the name suggests, LOCAL is a two phase commit. First, all cohorts are asked to prepare; if everyone agrees, then all cohorts are asked to commit. A problem can happen during the commit phase: if one or more members crash, then the system could be left in an inconsistent state.  - **TWO\_PHASE**: The TWO\_PHASE commit is more than the classic two phase commit (if you want a regular two phase commit, use local). Before TWO\_PHASE commits, it copies the commit log to other members, so in case of member failure, another member can complete the commit.  ```java import java.util.Queue; import java.util.Map; import java.util.Set; import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.Transaction;   HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();  TransactionOptions options = new TransactionOptions()     .setTransactionType( TransactionType.LOCAL );      TransactionContext context = hazelcastInstance.newTransactionContext( options ) context.beginTransaction();  TransactionalQueue queue = context.getQueue( \&quot;myqueue\&quot; ); TransactionalMap map = context.getMap( \&quot;mymap\&quot; ); TransactionalSet set = context.getSet( \&quot;myset\&quot; );  try {   Object obj = queue.poll();   //process obj   map.put( \&quot;1\&quot;, \&quot;value1\&quot; );   set.add( \&quot;value\&quot; );   //do other things..   context.commitTransaction(); } catch ( Throwable t ) {   context.rollbackTransaction(); } ```  In a transaction, operations will not be executed immediately. Their changes will be local to the `TransactionContext` until committed. However, they will ensure the changes via locks.   For the above example, when `map.put` is executed, no data will be put to the map but the key will get locked for changes. While committing, operations will be executed, the value will be put to the map, and the key will be unlocked.  Isolation level in Hazelcast Transactions is `READ_COMMITTED`. If you are in a transaction, you can read the data in your transaction and the data that is already committed. If you are not in a transaction, you can only read the committed data.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *The REPEATABLE_READ isolation level can also be exercised using the method `getForUpdate()` of `TransactionalMap`.*  Implementation is different for queue/set/list and map/multimap. For queue operations (offer, poll), offered and/or polled objects are copied to the owner member in order to safely commit/rollback. For map/multimap, Hazelcast first acquires the locks for the write operations (put, remove) and holds the differences (what is added/removed/updated) locally for each transaction. When the transaction is set to commit, Hazelcast will release the locks and apply the differences. When rolling back, Hazelcast will release the locks and discard the differences.  `MapStore` and `QueueStore` does not participate in transactions. Hazelcast will suppress exceptions thrown by store in a transaction. Please refer to the [XA Transactions section](#xa-transactions) for further information.  "

    body: "### LOCAL versus TWO PHASE  As it can be understood from the above [Transaction Interface section](#transaction-interface), when you choose LOCAL as the transaction type, Hazelcast tracks all changes you make locally in a commit log, i.e. list of changes. In this case, all the other members are asked to agree that the commit can succeed and once it is agreed, Hazelcast starts to write the changes.  However, if the member that initiates the commit crashes after it has written to at least one member (but has not completed writing to all other members), your system may be left in an inconsistent state.  On the other hand, if you choose TWO_PHASE as the transaction type, the commit log is again tracked locally but it is copied to another cluster member. Therefore, when a failure happens (e.g. the member initiating the commit crashes), you still have the commit log in another member and that member can complete the commit. However, copying the commit log to another member makes the TWO_PHASE approach slow.  Consequently, it is recommended that you choose LOCAL as the transaction type if you want a better performance and TWO_PHASE if reliability of your system is more important than the performance.

XA uses a two-phase commit to ensure that all resources either commit or rollback any particular transaction consistently (all do the same).  By implementing the `XAResource` interface, Hazelcast provides XA transactions. You can obtain the `HazelcastXAResource` instance via `HazelcastInstance`. Below is example code that uses Atomikos for transaction management.    ```java UserTransactionManager tm = new UserTransactionManager(); tm.setTransactionTimeout(60); tm.begin();  HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); HazelcastXAResource xaResource = hazelcastInstance.getXAResource();  Transaction transaction = tm.getTransaction(); transaction.enlistResource(xaResource); // other resources (database, app server etc...) can be enlisted  try {   TransactionContext context = xaResource.getTransactionContext();   TransactionalMap map = context.getMap(\&quot;m\&quot;);   map.put(\&quot;key\&quot;, \&quot;value\&quot;);   // other resource operations      transaction.delistResource(xaResource, XAResource.TMSUCCESS);   tm.commit(); } catch (Exception e) {   tm.rollback(); } ```     "

To show our commitment to this important specification the Java world was waiting for over a decade, we do not just provide a simple wrapper around our existing APIs but implemented a caching structure from ground up to optimize the behavior to the needs of JCache. As mentioned before, the Hazelcast JCache implementation is 100% TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) compliant and therefore passes all specification requirements.  In addition to the given specification, we added some features like asynchronous versions of almost all operations to give the user extra power.    This chapter gives a basic understanding of how to configure your application and how to setup Hazelcast to be your JCache provider. It also shows examples of basic JCache usage as well as the additionally offered features that are not part of JSR-107. To gain a full understanding of the JCache functionality and provided guarantees of different operations, read the specification document (which is also the main documentation for functionality) at the specification page of JSR-107:  [https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107)       "

The delegating `CachingProvider`s fully qualified class name is:  ```plain com.hazelcast.cache.HazelcastCachingProvider ```  To configure the delegating provider at the command line, add the following parameter to the Java startup call, depending on the chosen provider:  ```plain -Dhazelcast.jcache.provider.type=[client|server] ```  By default, the delegating `CachingProvider` is automatically picked up by the JCache SPI and provided as shown above. In cases where multiple `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider` implementations reside on the classpath (like in some Application Server scenarios), you can select a `CachingProvider` by explicitly calling `Caching::getCachingProvider` overloads and providing them using the canonical class name of the provider to be used.

    body: "### Roundup of Basics  In the [Quick Example section](#quick-example), we have already seen a couple of the base classes and explained how those work. Following are quick descriptions of them.  **`javax.cache.Caching`**:  The access point into the JCache API. It retrieves the general `CachingProvider` backed by any compliant JCache implementation, such as Hazelcast JCache.  **`javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider`**:  The SPI that is implemented to bridge between the JCache API and the implementation itself. Hazelcast nodes and clients use different providers chosen as seen in the [Provider Configuration section](#provider-configuration) which enable the JCache API to interact with Hazelcast clusters.  When a `javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider::getCacheManager` overload is used that takes a `java.lang.ClassLoader` argument, this classloader will be part of the scope of the created `java.cache.Cache` and it is not possible to retrieve it on other nodes. We advise not to use those overloads, those are not meant to be used in distributed environments!  **`javax.cache.CacheManager`**:  The `CacheManager` provides the capability to create new and manage existing JCache caches.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *A `javax.cache.Cache` instance created with key and value types in the configuration provides a type checking of those types at retrieval of the cache. For that reason, all non-types retrieval methods like `getCache` throw an exception because types cannot be checked.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  **`javax.cache.configuration.Configuration`**, **`javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration`**:  These two classes are used to configure a cache prior to retrieving it from a `CacheManager`. The `Configuration` interface, therefore, acts as a common super type for all compatible configuration classes such as `MutableConfiguration`.  Hazelcast itself offers a special implementation (`com.hazelcast.config.CacheConfig`) of the `Configuration` interface which offers more options on the specific Hazelcast properties that can be set to configure features like synchronous and asynchronous backups counts or selecting the underlying [In Memory Format](#in-memory-format) of the cache. For more information on this configuration class, please see the reference in [JCache Programmatic Configuration section](#jcache-programmatic-configuration).  **`javax.cache.Cache`**:  This interface represents the cache instance itself. It is comparable to `java.util.Map` but offers special operations dedicated to the caching use case. Therefore, for example `javax.cache.Cache::put`, unlike `java.util.Map::put`, does not return the old value previously assigned to the given key.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Bulk operations on the `Cache` interface guarantee atomicity per entry but not over all given keys in the same bulk operations since no transactional behavior is applied over the whole batch process.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;      "

These factory implementations are required to distribute the different features to nodes in a cluster environment like Hazelcast. Therefore, these factory implementations have to be serializable.  `Factory` implementations are easy to do: they follow the default Provider- or Factory-Pattern. The sample class `UserCacheEntryListenerFactory` shown below implements a custom JCache `Factory`.  ```java public class UserCacheEntryListenerFactory     implements Factory&lt;CacheEntryListener&lt;Integer, User&gt;&gt; {    @Override   public CacheEntryListener&lt;Integer, User&gt; create() {     // Just create a new listener instance     return new UserCacheEntryListener();   } } ```  To simplify the process for the users, JCache API offers a set of helper methods collected in `javax.cache. configuration.FactoryBuilder`. In the above configuration example, `FactoryBuilder::factoryOf` is used to create a singleton factory for the given instance.      "

    body: "### CacheLoader  `javax.cache.integration.CacheLoader` loads cache entries from any external backend resource. If the cache is configured to be `read-through`, then `CacheLoader::load` is called transparently from the cache when the key or the value is not yet found in the cache. If no value is found for a given key, it returns null.  If the cache is not configured to be `read-through`, nothing is loaded automatically. However, the user code must call `javax.cache.Cache::loadAll` to load data for the given set of keys into the cache.  For the bulk load operation (`loadAll()`), some keys may not be found in the returned result set. In this case, a `javax.cache.integration.CompletionListener` parameter can be used as an asynchronous callback after all the key-value pairs are loaded because loading many key-value pairs can take lots of time.  Let's look at the `UserCacheLoader` implementation.  ```java public class UserCacheLoader     implements CacheLoader&lt;Integer, User&gt;, Serializable {    private final UserDao userDao;    public UserCacheLoader( UserDao userDao ) {     // Store the dao instance created externally     this.userDao = userDao;   }    @Override   public User load( Integer key ) throws CacheLoaderException {     // Just call through into the dao     return userDao.findUserById( key );   }    @Override   public Map&lt;Integer, User&gt; loadAll( Iterable&lt;? extends Integer&gt; keys )       throws CacheLoaderException {      // Create the resulting map       Map&lt;Integer, User&gt; loaded = new HashMap&lt;Integer, User&gt;();     // For every key in the given set of keys     for ( Integer key : keys ) {       // Try to retrieve the user       User user = userDao.findUserById( key );       // If user is not found do not add the key to the result set       if ( user != null ) {         loaded.put( key, user );       }     }     return loaded;   } } ```  The implementation is quite straight forward.

If the cache is configured to be `write-through` this process is executed transparently to the users code otherwise at the current state there is no way to trigger writing changed entries to the external resource to a user defined point in time.  If bulk operations throw an exception, `java.util.Collection` has to be cleaned of all successfully written keys so the cache implementation can determine what keys are written and can be applied to the cache state.  ```java public class UserCacheWriter     implements CacheWriter&lt;Integer, User&gt;, Serializable {    private final UserDao userDao;    public UserCacheWriter( UserDao userDao ) {     // Store the dao instance created externally     this.userDao = userDao;   }    @Override   public void write( Cache.Entry&lt;? extends Integer, ? extends User&gt; entry )       throws CacheWriterException {      // Store the user using the dao     userDao.storeUser( entry.getKey(), entry.getValue() );   }    @Override   public void writeAll( Collection&lt;Cache.Entry&lt;...&gt;&gt; entries )       throws CacheWriterException {      // Retrieve the iterator to clean up the collection from     // written keys in case of an exception     Iterator&lt;Cache.Entry&lt;...&gt;&gt; iterator = entries.iterator();     while ( iterator.hasNext() ) {       // Write entry using dao       write( iterator.next() );       // Remove from collection of keys       iterator.remove();     }   }    @Override   public void delete( Object key ) throws CacheWriterException {     // Test for key type     if ( !( key instanceof Integer ) ) {       throw new CacheWriterException( \&quot;Illegal key type\&quot; );     }     // Remove user using dao     userDao.removeUser( ( Integer ) key );   }    @Override   public void deleteAll( Collection&lt;?&gt; keys ) throws CacheWriterException {     // Retrieve the iterator to clean up the collection from     // written keys in case of an exception     Iterator&lt;?&gt; iterator = keys.iterator();     while ( iterator.hasNext() ) {       // Write entry using dao       delete( iterator.next() );       // Remove from collection of keys       iterator.remove();     }   } } ```  Again the implementation is pretty straight forward and also as above all exceptions thrown by the external resource, like `java.sql.SQLException` has to be wrapped into a `javax.cache.integration.CacheWriterException`.

In a distributed environment like Hazelcast, you can move the mutating function to the node that owns the key. If the value object is big, it might prevent traffic by sending the object to the mutator and sending it back to the owner to update it.  By default, Hazelcast JCache sends the complete changed value to the backup partition. Again, this can cause a lot of traffic if the object is big. Another option to prevent this is part of the Hazelcast ICache extension. Further information is available at [BackupAwareEntryProcessor](#backupawareentryprocessor).  An arbitrary number of arguments can be passed to the `Cache::invoke` and `Cache::invokeAll` methods. All of those arguments need to be fully serializable because in a distributed environment like Hazelcast, it is very likely that these arguments have to be passed around the cluster.  ```java public class UserUpdateEntryProcessor     implements EntryProcessor&lt;Integer, User, User&gt; {    @Override   public User process( MutableEntry&lt;Integer, User&gt; entry, Object... arguments )       throws EntryProcessorException {      // Test arguments length     if ( arguments.length &lt; 1 ) {       throw new EntryProcessorException( \&quot;One argument needed: username\&quot; );     }      // Get first argument and test for String type     Object argument = arguments[0];     if ( !( argument instanceof String ) ) {       throw new EntryProcessorException(           \&quot;First argument has wrong type, required java.lang.String\&quot; );     }      // Retrieve the value from the MutableEntry     User user = entry.getValue();      // Retrieve the new username from the first argument     String newUsername = ( String ) arguments[0];      // Set the new username     user.setUsername( newUsername );      // Set the changed user to mark the entry as dirty     entry.setValue( user );      // Return the changed user to return it to the caller     return user;   } } ```  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *By executing the bulk `Cache::invokeAll` operation, atomicity is only guaranteed for a single cache entry.

The specification brings a set of sub-interfaces.  - `CacheEntryCreatedListener`: Fires after a cache entry is added (even on read-through by a `CacheLoader`) to the cache. - `CacheEntryUpdatedListener`: Fires after an already existing cache entry was updates. - `CacheEntryRemovedListener`: Fires after a cache entry was removed (not expired) from the cache. - `CacheEntryExpiredListener`: Fires after a cache entry has been expired. Expiry does not have to be parallel process, it is only required to be executed on the keys that are requested by `Cache::get` and some other operations. For a full table of expiry please see the [https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107) point 6.    To configure `CacheEntryListener`, add a `javax.cache.configuration.CacheEntryListenerConfiguration` instance to the JCache configuration class, as seen in the above example configuration. In addition listeners can be configured to be executed synchronously (blocking the calling thread) or asynchronously (fully running in parallel).  In this example application, the listener is implemented to print event information on the console. That visualizes what is going on in the cache.  ```java public class UserCacheEntryListener     implements CacheEntryCreatedListener&lt;Integer, User&gt;,         CacheEntryUpdatedListener&lt;Integer, User&gt;,         CacheEntryRemovedListener&lt;Integer, User&gt;,         CacheEntryExpiredListener&lt;Integer, User&gt; {    @Override   public void onCreated( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents )       throws CacheEntryListenerException {      printEvents( cacheEntryEvents );   }    @Override   public void onUpdated( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents )       throws CacheEntryListenerException {      printEvents( cacheEntryEvents );   }    @Override   public void onRemoved( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents )       throws CacheEntryListenerException {      printEvents( cacheEntryEvents );   }    @Override   public void onExpired( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents )       throws CacheEntryListenerException {      printEvents( cacheEntryEvents );   }    private void printEvents( Iterable&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; cacheEntryEvents ) {     Iterator&lt;CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt;&gt; iterator = cacheEntryEvents.iterator();     while ( iterator.hasNext() ) {       CacheEntryEvent&lt;...&gt; event = iterator.next();       System.out.println( event.getEventType() );     }   } } ```      "

The minimum allowed `TimeUnit` is `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS`. The long value `durationAmount` must be equal or greater than zero. A value of zero (or `Duration.ZERO`) indicates that the cache entry expires immediately.  By default, JCache delivers a set of predefined expiry strategies in the standard API.  - `AccessedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured from creation of the cache entry, the expiry timeout is updated on accessing the key. - `CreatedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured from creation of the cache entry, the expiry timeout is never updated. - `EternalExpiryPolicy`: Never expires, this is the default behavior, similar to `ExpiryPolicy` to be set to null. - `ModifiedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured from creation of the cache entry, the expiry timeout is updated on updating the key. - `TouchedExpiryPolicy`: Expires after a given set of time measured from creation of the cache entry, the expiry timeout is updated on accessing or updating the key.

For more information on eviction, please see the [JCache Eviction](#jcache-eviction).   - `size`: The maximum number of records or maximum size in bytes depending on the `max-size-policy` property. Size can be any integer between `0` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Default max-size-policy is `ENTRY_COUNT` and default size is `10.000`.   - `max-size-policy`: The size policy property defines a maximum size.

Most importantly, in typical production system two common types of caches are found:  - **Reference Caches**: Caches for reference data are normally small and are used to speed up the de-referencing as a lookup table. Those caches are commonly tend to be small and contain a previously known, fixed number of elements (e.g. states of the USA or abbreviations of elements). - **Active DataSet Caches**:  The other type of caches normally caches an active data set.

The built-in implementations provide an amortized O(1) runtime and therefore provide a highly predictable runtime behavior which does not rely on any kind of background threads to handle the eviction. Therefore, the algorithm takes some assumptions into account to prevent network operations and concurrent accesses.  As an explanation of how the algorithm works, let's examine the following flowchart step by step.  ![](images/eviction/eviction-flowchart.png)  1. A new cache is created. Without any special settings, the eviction is configured to kick in when the **cache** exceeds 10.000 elements and an LRU (Less Recently Used) policy is set up. 2. The user puts in a new entry (e.g. a key-value pair). 3. For every put, the eviction strategy evaluates the current cache size and decides if an eviction is necessary or not. If not the entry is stored in step 10. 4. If eviction is required, a new sampling is started. The built-in sampler is implemented as an lazy iterator. 5. The sampling algorithm selects a random sample from the underlying data storage. 6. The eviction strategy tests the sampled entry to already be expired (lazy expiration). If expired, the sampling stops and the entry is removed in step 9. 7. If not yet expired, the entry (eviction candidate) is compared to the last best matching candidate (based on the eviction policy) and the new best matching candidate is remembered. 8. The sampling is repeated for 15 times and then the best matching eviction candidate is returned to the eviction strategy. 9. The expired or best matching eviction candidate is removed from the underlying data storage. 10. The new put entry is stored. 11. The put operation returns to the user.  As seen by the flowchart, the general eviction operation is easy. As long as the cache does not reach its maximum capacity or you execute updates (put/replace), no eviction is executed.  To prevent network operations and concurrent access, as mentioned earlier, the cache size is estimated based on the size of the currently handled partition. Due to the imbalanced partitions, the single partitions might start to evict earlier than the other partitions.  As mentioned in the [General Information section](#general-information), typically two types of caches are found in the production systems. For small caches, referred to as *Reference Caches*, the eviction algorithm has a special set of rules depending on the maximum configured cache size. Please see the [Reference Caches section](#reference-caches) for details. The other type of cache is referred to as *Active DataSet Cache*, which in most cases makes heavy use of the eviction to keep the most active data set in the memory. Those kinds of caches using a very simple but efficient way to estimate the cluster-wide cache size.  All of the following calculations have a well known set of fixed variables:  - `GlobalCapacity`: The user defined maximum cache size (cluster-wide). - `PartitionCount`: The number of partitions in the cluster (defaults to 271). - `BalancedPartitionSize`: The number of elements in a balanced partition state, `BalancedPartitionSize := GlobalCapacity / PartitionCount`. - `Deviation`: An approximated standard deviation (tests proofed it to be pretty near), `Deviation := sqrt(BalancedPartitionSize)`.

    body: "##### Reference Caches  A Reference Cache is typically small and the number of elements to store in the reference caches is normally  known prior to creating the cache. Typical examples of reference caches are lookup tables for abbreviations or the states of a country. They tend to have a fixed but small element number and the eviction is an unlikely event and rather undesirable behavior.  Since an imbalanced partition is the worst problem in the small and mid-sized caches than for the caches with millions of entries, the normal estimation rule (as discussed in a bit) is not applied to these kinds of caches. To prevent unwanted eviction on the small and mid-sized caches, Hazelcast implements a special set of rules to estimate the cluster size.  To adjust the imbalance of partitions as found in the typical runtime, the actual calculated maximum cache size (as known as the eviction threshold) is slightly higher than the user defined size. That means more elements can be stored into the cache than expected by the user. This needs to be taken into account especially for large objects, since those can easily exceed the expected memory consumption!  **Small caches:**  If a cache is configured with no more than `4.000` element, this cache is considered to be a small cache. The actual partition size is derived from the number of elements (`GlobalCapacity`) and the deviation using the following formula:  ```plain MaxPartitionSize := Deviation * 5 + BalancedPartitionSize ```  This formula ends up with big partition sizes which summed up exceed the expected maximum cache size (set by the user),  but since the small caches typically have a well known maximum number of elements, this is not a big issue. Only if the small caches are used for a use case other than using it as a reference cache, this needs to be taken into account.  **Mid-sized caches**  A mid-sized cache is defined as a cache with a maximum number of elements that is bigger than `4.000` but not bigger than `1.000.000` elements. The calculation of mid-sized caches is similar to that of the small caches but with a different multiplier. To calculate the maximum number of elements per partition, the following formula is used:  ```plain MaxPartitionSize := Deviation * 3 + BalancedPartitionSize ```  "

Near cache invalidation happens asynchronously at the cluster level, but synchronously in real-time at the current node. This means when an entry is updated (explicitly or via entry processor) or removed (deleted explicitly or via entry processor, evicted, expired), it is invalidated from all near caches asynchronously within the whole cluster but updated/removed at/from the current node synchronously. Generally, whenever the state of an entry changes in the record store by updating its value or removing it, the invalidation event is sent for that entry.  Invalidation events can be sent either individually or in batches. If there are lots of mutating operations such as put/remove on the cache, sending the events in batches is advised. This reduces the network traffic and keeps the eventing system less busy.   You can use the following system properties to configure the sending of invalidation events in batches:  - `hazelcast.cache.invalidation.batch.enabled`: Specifies whether the cache invalidation event batch sending is enabled or not. The default value is `true`. - `hazelcast.cache.invalidation.batch.size`: Defines the maximum number of cache invalidation events to be drained and sent to the event listeners in a batch.

Entries that are older than `&lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;` will be automatically evicted from the near cache. It can be any integer between `0` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. `0` means **infinite**. Default value is `0`. - `max-idle-seconds`: Maximum number of seconds each entry can stay in the near cache as untouched (not-read). Entries that are not read (touched) more than `&lt;max-idle-seconds&gt;` value will be removed from the near cache.

    body: "### BackupAwareEntryProcessor  Another feature, especially interesting for distributed environments like Hazelcast, is the JCache specified `javax.cache.processor.EntryProcessor`. For more general information, please see the [JCache EntryProcessor section](#jcache-entryprocessor).  Since Hazelcast provides backups of cached entries on other nodes, the default way to backup an object changed by an `EntryProcessor` is to serialize the complete object and send it to the backup partition. This can be a huge network overhead for big objects.  Hazelcast offers a sub-interface for `EntryProcessor` called `com.hazelcast.cache.BackupAwareEntryProcessor`. This allows the user to create or pass another `EntryProcessor` to run on backup partitions and apply delta changes to the backup entries.  The backup partition `EntryProcessor` can either be the currently running processor (by returning `this`) or it can be a specialized `EntryProcessor` implementation (other from the currently running one) which does different operations or leaves out operations, e.g. sending emails.  If we again take the `EntryProcessor` example from the demonstration application provided in the [JCache EntryProcessor section](#jcache-entryprocessor), the changed code will look like the following snippet.  ```java public class UserUpdateEntryProcessor     implements BackupAwareEntryProcessor&lt;Integer, User, User&gt; {    @Override   public User process( MutableEntry&lt;Integer, User&gt; entry, Object... arguments )       throws EntryProcessorException {      // Test arguments length     if ( arguments.length &lt; 1 ) {       throw new EntryProcessorException( \&quot;One argument needed: username\&quot; );     }      // Get first argument and test for String type     Object argument = arguments[0];     if ( !( argument instanceof String ) ) {       throw new EntryProcessorException(           \&quot;First argument has wrong type, required java.lang.String\&quot; );     }      // Retrieve the value from the MutableEntry     User user = entry.getValue();      // Retrieve the new username from the first argument     String newUsername = ( String ) arguments[0];      // Set the new username     user.setUsername( newUsername );      // Set the changed user to mark the entry as dirty     entry.setValue( user );      // Return the changed user to return it to the caller     return user;   }    public EntryProcessor&lt;K, V, T&gt; createBackupEntryProcessor() {     return this;   } } ```  You can use the additional method `BackupAwareEntryProcessor::createBackupEntryProcessor` to create or return the `EntryProcessor` implementation to run on the backup partition (in the example above, the same processor again).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *For the backup runs, the returned value from the backup processor is ignored and not returned to the user.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;      "

If server A goes down, your users on that server will be directed to one of the live servers (B or C), but their sessions will be lost.  We need to have all these sessions backed up somewhere if we do not want to lose the sessions upon server crashes. Hazelcast Web Manager (WM) allows you to cluster user HTTP sessions automatically. The following are required before enabling Hazelcast Session Clustering:  -   Target application or web server should support Java 1.6 or higher.  -   Target application or web server should support Servlet 3.0 or higher spec.  -   Session objects that need to be clustered have to be Serializable.  -   In the client/server architecture, session classes does not have to be present in the server classpath.  Here are the steps to setup Hazelcast Session Clustering:  -	Put the `hazelcast` and `hazelcast-wm` jars in your `WEB-INF/lib` directory. Optionally, if you wish to connect to a cluster as a client, add `hazelcast-client` as well.  -	Put the following XML into `web.xml` file. Make sure Hazelcast filter is placed before all the other filters if any; for example, you can put it at the top.  ```xml              &lt;filter&gt;   &lt;filter-name&gt;hazelcast-filter&lt;/filter-name&gt;   &lt;filter-class&gt;com.hazelcast.web.WebFilter&lt;/filter-class&gt;   &lt;!--     Name of the distributed map storing     your web session objects   --&gt;   &lt;init-param&gt;     &lt;param-name&gt;map-name&lt;/param-name&gt;     &lt;param-value&gt;my-sessions&lt;/param-value&gt;   &lt;/init-param&gt;   &lt;!--     TTL value of the distributed map storing     your web session objects.

You have to know how your load-balancer is configured before     setting this parameter.

It will not update the distributed map upon each attribute update, but will only call it once at the end of the request.

One exception to this behavior is the changes to the session attribute objects. To update an attribute cluster-wide, `setAttribute` must be called after changes are made to the attribute object.  The following example explains how to update an attribute in the case of `deferred-write=false` setting:   ``` session.setAttribute(\&quot;myKey\&quot;, new ArrayList()); List list1 = session.getAttribute(\&quot;myKey\&quot;); list1.add(\&quot;myValue\&quot;);  session.setAttribute(\&quot;myKey\&quot;, list1); // changes updated in the cluster ```  "

Therefore, when a request arrives at one of those other nodes, that attribute value is fetched from clustered cache.  - To overcome the performance penalty of sending invalidation messages during updates, you can use sticky sessions. If Hazelcast knows sessions are sticky, invalidation will not be sent because Hazelcast assumes there is no other local session at the moment. When a server is down, requests belonging to a session hold in that server will routed to other server, and that server will fetch session data from clustered cache.

In case of failovers, Hazelcast helps you not lose existing sessions.   ***Non-Sticky Sessions***  Non-Sticky Sessions are not good for performance because you need to move session data all over the cluster every time a new request comes in.  However, load balancing might be super easy with Non-Sticky caches. In case of heavy load, you can distribute the request to the least used Tomcat instance. Hazelcast supports Non-Sticky Sessions as well.   "

When Tomcat Failure happens and Load Balancer cannot redirect the request to the owning instance, it sends a request to one of the available Tomcat instances. Since the `jvmRoute` parameter of session ID is different than that of the target Tomcat instance, Hazelcast Session Replication Module updates the session ID of the session with the new `jvmRoute` parameter.

Please see the following explanations for configuring these managers.    *Configuring the HazelcastSessionIdManager*    You need to configure a `com.hazelcast.session.HazelcastSessionIdManager` instance in `jetty.xml`. Add the following lines to your `jetty.xml`.    ```xml  &lt;Set name=\&quot;sessionIdManager\&quot;&gt;      &lt;New id=\&quot;hazelcastIdMgr\&quot; class=\&quot;com.hazelcast.session.HazelcastSessionIdManager\&quot;&gt;          &lt;Arg&gt;&lt;Ref id=\&quot;Server\&quot;/&gt;&lt;/Arg&gt;          &lt;Set name=\&quot;configLocation\&quot;&gt;etc/hazelcast.xml&lt;/Set&gt;      &lt;/New&gt;  &lt;/Set&gt;  ```    *Configuring the HazelcastSessionManager*      `HazelcastSessionManager` can be configured from a `context.xml` file.

Use the following parameters to configure Jetty Session Replication Module to better serve your needs.    - `savePeriod`: Sets the interval of saving session data to the Hazelcast cluster. Jetty Web Session Replication Module has its own nature of caching. Attribute changes during the HTTP Request/HTTP Response cycle are cached by default. Distributing those changes to the Hazelcast Cluster is costly, so Session Replication is only done at the end of each request for updated and deleted attributes. The risk with this approach is losing data if a Jetty crash happens in the middle of the HTTP Request operation.  You can change that behavior by setting the `savePeriod` attribute.    Notes:    - If `savePeriod` is set to **-2**, `HazelcastSessionManager.save` method is called for every `doPutOrRemove` operation.  - If it is set to **-1**, the same method is never called if Jetty is not shut down.  - If it is set to **0** (the default value), the same method is called at the end of request.  - If it is set to **1**, the same method is called at the end of request if session is dirty.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;      "

The clustered session mechanism works in conjunction with a load balancer that supports stickiness. Stickiness can be based on various data items, such as source IP address, or characteristics of the session ID, or a load-balancer specific mechanism.   For those load balancers that examine the session ID, `HazelcastSessionIdManager` appends a node ID to the session ID, which can be used for routing.  You must configure the `HazelcastSessionIdManager` with a `workerName` that is unique across the cluster.   Typically the name relates to the physical node on which the instance is executed. If this name is not unique, your load balancer might fail to distribute your sessions correctly.  If sticky sessions are enabled, the `workerName` parameter has to be set, as shown below.      ```xml  &lt;Set name=\&quot;sessionIdManager\&quot;&gt;      &lt;New id=\&quot;hazelcastIdMgr\&quot; class=\&quot;com.hazelcast.session.HazelcastSessionIdManager\&quot;&gt;          &lt;Arg&gt;&lt;Ref id=\&quot;Server\&quot;/&gt;&lt;/Arg&gt;          &lt;Set name=\&quot;configLocation\&quot;&gt;etc/hazelcast.xml&lt;/Set&gt;          &lt;Set name=\&quot;workerName\&quot;&gt;unique-worker-1&lt;/Set&gt;      &lt;/New&gt;  &lt;/Set&gt;  ```      &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     "

Since Hazelcast `Map`s/`Collection`s are designed to hold very large data which a single machine cannot carry, iterating through whole values can cause out of memory errors.

This solution is used with the Hazelcast JCache implementation.   By default, Hazelcast offers a production ready, low garbage collection (GC) pressure, storage backend. Serialized keys and values are still stored in the standard Java map, such as data structures on the heap. The data structures are stored in serialized form for the highest data compaction, and are still subject to Java Garbage Collection.  In Hazelcast Enterprise, the High-Density Memory Store is built around a pluggable memory manager which enables multiple memory stores. These memory stores are all accessible using a common access layer that scales up to Terabytes of main memory on a single JVM. At the same time, by further minimizing the GC pressure, High-Density Memory Store enables predictable application scaling and boosts performance and latency while minimizing pauses for Java Garbage Collection.  This foundation includes, but is not limited to, storing keys and values next to the heap in a native memory region.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *Please refer to the [Hazelcast JCache chapter](#hazelcast-jcache) for the details of Hazelcast JCache implementation.

Also, you can configure its size, memory allocator type, minimum block size, page size and metadata space percentage.  - **size:** Size of the total native memory to allocate. Default value is **512 MB**. - **allocator type:** Type of the memory allocator. Available values are:   * STANDARD: allocate/free memory using default OS memory manager.   * POOLED: manage memory blocks in thread local pools.     Default value is **POOLED**. - **minimum block size:** Minimum size of the blocks in bytes to split and fragment a page block to assign to an allocation request. It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Default value is **16**. - **page size:** Size of the page in bytes to allocate memory as a block. It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Default value is `1 &lt;&lt; 22` = **4194304 Bytes**, about **4 MB**. - **metadata space percentage:** Defines the percentage of the allocated native memory that is used for the metadata such as indexes, offsets, etc. It is used only by the **POOLED** memory allocator. Default value is **12.5**.  The following is the programmatic configuration example.  ```java MemorySize memorySize = new MemorySize(512, MemoryUnit.MEGABYTES); NativeMemoryConfig nativeMemoryConfig =                 new NativeMemoryConfig()                         .setAllocatorType(NativeMemoryConfig.MemoryAllocatorType.POOLED)                         .setSize(memorySize)                         .setEnabled(true)                         .setMinBlockSize(16)                         .setPageSize(1 &lt;&lt; 20); ```  The following is the declarative configuration example.  ```xml &lt;native-memory enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; allocator-type=\&quot;POOLED\&quot;&gt;   &lt;size value=\&quot;512\&quot; unit=\&quot;MEGABYTES\&quot;/&gt; &lt;/native-memory&gt; ```  "

    body: "## Elastic Memory (High-Density Memory First Generation)  By default, Hazelcast stores your distributed data (map entries, queue items) into Java heap which is subject to garbage collection (GC). As your heap gets bigger, garbage collection might cause your application to pause tens of seconds, badly effecting your application performance and response times. Elastic Memory (High-Density Memory First Generation) is Hazelcast with off-heap memory storage to avoid GC pauses. Even if you have terabytes of cache in-memory with lots of updates, GC will have almost no effect; resulting in more predictable latency and throughput.  Here are the steps to enable Elastic Memory:  - Set the maximum direct memory JVM can allocate, e.g. `java -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=60G`. - Enable Elastic Memory by setting the `hazelcast.elastic.memory.enabled` property to true. - Set the total direct memory size for HazelcastInstance by setting the `hazelcast.elastic.memory.total.size` property. Size can be in MB or GB and abbreviation can be used, such as 60G and 500M. - Set the chunk size by setting the `hazelcast.elastic.memory.chunk.size` property. Hazelcast will partition the entire off-heap memory into chunks. Default chunk size is 1K. - You can enable `sun.misc.Unsafe` based off-heap storage implementation instead of `java.nio.DirectByteBuffer` based one, by setting the `hazelcast.elastic.memory.unsafe.enabled` property to true. Default value is false. - Configure maps that will use Elastic Memory by setting `InMemoryFormat` to NATIVE. Default value is BINARY.  Below is the declarative configuration.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;map name=\&quot;default\&quot;&gt;     ...     &lt;in-memory-format&gt;NATIVE&lt;/in-memory-format&gt;   &lt;/map&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  And, the programmatic configuration:  ```java MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig(); mapConfig.setInMemoryFormat( InMemoryFormat.NATIVE ); ```  And, the following are the High-Density Memory First Generation related system properties.  |Property|Default Value|Type|Description| |:-------|:-------|:-----------| |`hazelcast.elastic.memory.enabled`|false|bool|Enables/disables Elastic Memory usage. |`hazelcast.elastic.memory.total.size`|128|int|Elastic Memory storage total size in MB or GB. |`hazelcast.elastic.memory.chunk.size`|1|int|Elastic Memory storage chunk size in KB. |`hazelcast.elastic.memory.shared.storage`|false|bool|Enables/disables Elastic Memory shared storage. |`hazelcast.elastic.memory.unsafe.enabled`|false|bool|Enables/disables usage of `sun.misc.Unsafe` when allocating, reading and modifying off-heap storage.

If you use a single backup, it means the total memory footprint is two times the active data (active data + backup data). If you use, for example, two backups, then the total memory footprint is three times the active data (active data + backup data + backup data).  If you use only heap memory, each Hazelcast node with a 4 GB heap should accommodate a maximum of 3.5 GB of total data (active and backup). If you use the High-Density Memory Store, up to 75% of your physical memory footprint may be used for active and backup data, with headroom of 25% for normal fragmentation. In both cases, however, you should also keep some memory headroom available to handle any node failure or explicit node shutdown. When a node leaves the cluster, the data previously owned by the newly offline node will be distributed among the remaining servers. For this reason, we recommend that you plan to use only 60% of available memory, with 40% headroom to handle node failure or shutdown.      "

We will use the programmatic approach throughout this tutorial. Please refer to the [Java Client Declarative Configuration section](#java-client-configuration) for details.  ```java ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); clientConfig.getGroupConfig().setName(\&quot;dev\&quot;).setPassword(\&quot;dev-pass\&quot;); clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().addAddress(\&quot;10.90.0.1\&quot;, \&quot;10.90.0.2:5702\&quot;); ```  The second step is to initialize the HazelcastInstance to be connected to the cluster.  ```java HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig); ```  *This client interface is your gateway to access all Hazelcast distributed objects.*  Let's create a map and populate it with some data.  ```java  IMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; mapCustomers = client.getMap(\&quot;customers\&quot;); //creates the map proxy  mapCustomers.put(\&quot;1\&quot;, new Customer(\&quot;Joe\&quot;, \&quot;Smith\&quot;)); mapCustomers.put(\&quot;2\&quot;, new Customer(\&quot;Ali\&quot;, \&quot;Selam\&quot;)); mapCustomers.put(\&quot;3\&quot;, new Customer(\&quot;Avi\&quot;, \&quot;Noyan\&quot;));  ```  As a final step, if you are done with your client, you can shut it down as shown below. This will release all the used resources and will close connections to the cluster.  ```java  client.shutdown();  ```  "

Since each data partition uses the well known and consistent hashing algorithm, each client can send an operation to the relevant cluster node, which increases the overall throughput and efficiency. Smart mode is the default mode.   **Dummy Client**: For some cases, the clients can be required to connect to a single node instead of to each node in the cluster. Firewalls, security, or some custom networking issues can be the reason for these cases.  In dummy client mode, the client will only connect to one of the configured addresses. This single node will behave as a gateway to the other nodes. For any operation requested from the client, it will redirect the request to the relevant node and return the response back to the client returned from this node.  "

Please see the [Distributed Queue section](#queue) for more information.  **Topic**:  `getLocalTopicStats` is not supported because locality is ambiguous for the client.  **Other Supported Distributed Structures**:  The distributed data structures listed below are also supported by the client.

It can be used to execute tasks on the cluster on a designated partition or on all the partitions. It can also be used to process entries. Please see the [Distributed Executor Service section](#executor-service) for more information.  ```java IExecutorService executorService = client.getExecutorService(\&quot;default\&quot;); ```   After getting an instance of `IExecutorService`, you can use the instance as the interface with the one provided on the server side. Please see the [Distributed Computing chapter](#distributed-computing) chapter for detailed usage.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *This service is only supported by the Java client.*   **Client Service**:  If you need to track clients and you want to listen to their connection events, you can use the `clientConnected` and `clientDisconnected` methods of the `ClientService` class. This class must be run on the **node** side. The following is an example code.  ```java final ClientService clientService = hazelcastInstance.getClientService(); final Collection&lt;Client&gt; connectedClients = clientService.getConnectedClients();  clientService.addClientListener(new ClientListener() {     @Override     public void clientConnected(Client client) { 	//Handle client connected event     }      @Override     public void clientDisconnected(Client client) {       //Handle client disconnected event     } }); ```  **Partition Service**:  You use partition service to find the partition of a key. It will return all partitions. See the example code below.  ```java PartitionService partitionService = client.getPartitionService();  //partition of a key Partition partition = partitionService.getPartition(key);  //all partitions Set&lt;Partition&gt; partitions = partitionService.getPartitions(); ```   **Lifecycle Service**:  Lifecycle handling performs the following:  - checks to see if the client is running, - shuts down the client gracefully, - terminates the client ungracefully (forced shutdown), and - adds/removes lifecycle listeners.   ```java LifecycleService lifecycleService = client.getLifecycleService();  if(lifecycleService.isRunning()){     //it is running }  //shutdown client gracefully lifecycleService.shutdown();  ```  "

    body: "## Java Client Configuration  Hazelcast Java Client can be configured declaratively (XML) or programmatically (API).   For declarative configuration, the Hazelcast client looks into the following places for the client configuration file  - **System property**: The client first checks if `hazelcast.client.config` system property is set to a file path, e.g. `-Dhazelcast.client.config=C:/myhazelcast.xml`.  - **Classpath**: If config file is not set as a system property, the client checks the classpath for `hazelcast-client.xml` file.  If the client does not find any configuration file, it starts with the default configuration (`hazelcast-client-default.xml`) located in the `hazelcast-client.jar` library. Before configuring the client, please try to work with the default configuration to see if it works for you. Default should be just fine for most of the users. If not, then consider custom configuration for your environment.  If you want to specify your own configuration file to create a `Config` object, the Hazelcast client supports the following.  - `Config cfg = new XmlClientConfigBuilder(xmlFileName).build();`  - `Config cfg = new XmlClientConfigBuilder(inputStream).build();`   For programmatic configuration of the Hazelcast Java Client, just instantiate a `ClientConfig` object and configure the desired aspects, a sample of which is shown below.  ```java ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); clientConfig.setGroupConfig(new GroupConfig(\&quot;dev\&quot;,\&quot;dev-pass”); clientConfig.setLoadBalancer(yourLoadBalancer); ... ... ```   "

You can create Near Cache on the client side by providing a configuration per map name, as shown below.  ```java ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); CacheConfig nearCacheConfig = new NearCacheConfig(); nearCacheConfig.setName(\&quot;mapName\&quot;); clientConfig.addNearCacheConfig(nearCacheConfig); ```  You can use wildcards for the map name, as shown below.  ```java nearCacheConfig.setName(\&quot;map*\&quot;); nearCacheConfig.setName(\&quot;*map\&quot;); ```  And, the following is an example declarative configuration for Near Cache.   ```xml &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt; 	... 	... 	&lt;near-cache name=\&quot;MENU\&quot;&gt; 		&lt;max-size&gt;2000&lt;/max-size&gt; 		&lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;0&lt;/time-to-live-seconds&gt; 		&lt;max-idle-seconds&gt;0&lt;/max-idle-seconds&gt; 		&lt;eviction-policy&gt;LFU&lt;/eviction-policy&gt; 		&lt;invalidate-on-change&gt;true&lt;/invalidate-on-change&gt; 		&lt;in-memory-format&gt;OBJECT&lt;/in-memory-format&gt; 	&lt;/near-cache&gt; 	... &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt; ```  Name of Near Cache on client side must be the same as the name of IMap on server for which this Near Cache is being created.

Assuming `mapName` and `queueName` are already configured in your Hazelcast, its structure is shown below.  `http://node IP address:port/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key`  `http://node IP address:port/hazelcast/rest/queues/queueName`  For the operations to be performed, standard REST conventions for HTTP calls are used.    Assume that your cluster members are as shown below.  ```plain Members [5] {   Member [10.20.17.1:5701]   Member [10.20.17.2:5701]   Member [10.20.17.4:5701]   Member [10.20.17.3:5701]   Member [10.20.17.5:5701] } ```  ---  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE***: *All of the requests below can return one of the following responses in case of a failure.*  - If the HTTP request syntax is not known, the following response will be returned.  ```plain HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Content-Length: 0 ```   - In case of an unexpected exception, the following response will be returned.  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error &lt; Content-Length: 0 ```  ---   **Creating/Updating Entries in a Map**  You can put a new `key1/value1` entry into a map by using POST call to  `http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/ rest/maps/mapName/key1` URL. This call's content body should contain the value of the key. Also, if the call contains the MIME type, Hazelcast stores this information, too.   A sample POST call is shown below.  ```plain $ curl -v -X POST -H \&quot;Content-Type: text/plain\&quot; -d \&quot;bar\&quot;      http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo ```  It will return the following response if successful:  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK &lt; Content-Type: text/plain &lt; Content-Length: 0 ```  **Retrieving Entries from a Map**  If you want to retrieve an entry, you can use a GET call to `http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/key1`. You can also retrieve this entry from another member of your cluster, such as  `http://10.20.17.3:5701/hazelcast/rest/ maps/mapName/key1`.  An example of a GET call is shown below.  ```plain $ curl -X GET http://10.20.17.3:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo ```  It will return the following response if there is a corresponding value:  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK &lt; Content-Type: text/plain &lt; Content-Length: 3 bar ```  This GET call returned a value, its length, and also the MIME type (`text/plain`) since the POST call example shown above included the MIME type.  It will return the following if there is no mapping for the given key:  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 204 No Content &lt; Content-Length: 0 ```   **Removing Entries from a Map**  You can use a DELETE call to remove an entry. A sample DELETE call is shown below with its response.  ```plain $ curl -v -X DELETE http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName/foo ``` ``` &lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK &lt; Content-Type: text/plain &lt; Content-Length: 0 ``` If you leave the key empty as follows, DELETE will delete all entries from the map.  ```plain $ curl -v -X DELETE http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/mapName ```  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK &lt; Content-Type: text/plain &lt; Content-Length: 0 ```  **Offering Items on a Queue**  You can use a POST call to create an item on the queue.

It will return the following if successful:  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK &lt; Content-Type: text/plain &lt; Content-Length: 0 ```  It will return the following if the queue is full and the item is not able to be offered to the queue:  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable &lt; Content-Length: 0 ```  **Retrieving Items from a Queue**  You can use a DELETE call for retrieving items from a queue. Note that you should state the poll timeout while polling for queue events by an extra path parameter.   An example is shown below (**10** being the timeout value).  ```plain $ curl -v -X DELETE \http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/queues/myEvents/10 ```  The above call is equivalent to `HazelcastInstance#getQueue(\&quot;myEvents\&quot;).poll(10, SECONDS);`. Below is the response.  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK &lt; Content-Type: text/plain &lt; Content-Length: 3 foo ```  When the timeout is reached, the response will be `No Content` success, i.e. there is no item on the queue to be returned.   ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 204 No Content &lt; Content-Length: 0 ```   **Getting the size of the queue**  ```plain $ curl -v -X GET \http://10.20.17.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/queues/myEvents/size ```  The above call is equivalent to `HazelcastInstance#getQueue(\&quot;myEvents\&quot;).size();`. Below is a sample response.  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK &lt; Content-Type: text/plain &lt; Content-Length: 1 5 ``` --- Besides the above operations, you can check the status of your cluster, a sample of which is shown below.  ```plain $ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:5701/hazelcast/rest/cluster ```  The return will be similar to the following:  ```plain &lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK &lt; Content-Length: 119  Members [5] {   Member [10.20.17.1:5701] this   Member [10.20.17.2:5701]   Member [10.20.17.4:5701]   Member [10.20.17.3:5701]   Member [10.20.17.5:5701] }  ConnectionCount: 5 AllConnectionCount: 20 ```  ---  RESTful access is provided through any member of your cluster. You can even put an HTTP load-balancer in front of your cluster members for load balancing and fault tolerance.   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE***: *You need to handle the failures on REST polls as there is no transactional guarantee.*        "

Here is a Java client code example with SpyMemcached client:  ```java MemcachedClient client = new MemcachedClient(     AddrUtil.getAddresses( \&quot;10.20.17.1:5701 10.20.17.2:5701\&quot; ) ); client.set( \&quot;key1\&quot;, 3600, \&quot;value1\&quot; ); System.out.println( client.get( \&quot;key1\&quot; ) ); ```  If you want your data to be stored in different maps (e.g. to utilize per map configuration), you can do that with a map name prefix as in the following example code.   ```java MemcachedClient client = new MemcachedClient(     AddrUtil.getAddresses( \&quot;10.20.17.1:5701 10.20.17.2:5701\&quot; ) ); client.set( \&quot;map1:key1\&quot;, 3600, \&quot;value1\&quot; ); // store to *hz_memcache_map1 client.set( \&quot;map2:key1\&quot;, 3600, \&quot;value1\&quot; ); // store to hz_memcache_map2 System.out.println( client.get( \&quot;key1\&quot; ) ); // get from hz_memcache_map1 System.out.println( client.get( \&quot;key2\&quot; ) ); // get from hz_memcache_map2 ```  *hz\_memcache prefix\_* separates Memcache maps from Hazelcast maps. If no map name is given, it will be stored in a default map named *hz_memcache_default*.  An entry written with a Memcache client can be read by another Memcache client written in another language.

The data and its replicas are stored in different partitions on multiple nodes. The data you need may not be present on the local machine, and in that case, Hazelcast retrieves that data from another machine. This requires serialization.  Hazelcast serializes all your objects into an instance of `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.Data`. `Data` is the binary representation of an object.   Serialization is used when:  - key/value objects are added to a map, - items are put in a queue/set/list, - a runnable is sent using an executor service, - an entry processing is performed within a map, - an object is locked, and - a message is sent to a topic.   Hazelcast optimizes the serialization for the below types. You cannot override this behavior.  ![image](images/OptimizedTypes.jpg)   Hazelcast also optimizes the following types. However, you can override these types by creating a custom serializer and registering it. See [Custom Serialization](#custom-serialization) for more information.  ![image](images/OptimizedTypesII.jpg)   Hazelcast optimizes all of the above object types.

If all of the above checks do not work, then serialization will fail. When a class implements multiple interfaces, the above steps are important to determine the serialization mechanism that Hazelcast will use.

    title: "Serializable &amp; Externalizable",
    body: "## Serializable &amp; Externalizable  A class often needs to implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface; native Java serialization is the easiest way to do serialization. Let's take a look at the example code below.  ```java public class Employee implements Serializable {    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;   private String surname;      public Employee( String surname ) {      this.surname = surname;   }  } ```  Here, the fields that are non-static and non-transient are automatically serialized. To eliminate class compatibility issues, it is recommended that you add a `serialVersionUID`, as shown above. Also, when you are using methods that perform byte-content comparisons (e.g. `IMap.replace()`) and if byte-content of equal objects is different, you may face unexpected behaviors. Therefore, if the class relies on, for example, a hash map, `replace` method may fail. The reason for this is the hash map is a serialized data structure with unreliable byte-content.  Hazelcast also supports `java.io.Externalizable`. This interface offers more control on the way fields are serialized or deserialized. Compared to native Java serialization, it also can have a positive effect on performance. With `java.io.Externalizable`, there is no need to add `serialVersionUID`.  Let's take a look at the example code below.  ```java public class Employee implements Externalizable {    private String surname;   public Employee(String surname) {          this.surname = surname;   }      @Override   public void readExternal( ObjectInput in )       throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {     this.surname = in.readUTF();   }        @Override   public void writeExternal( ObjectOutput out )       throws IOException {     out.writeUTF(surname);    } } ```  Writing and reading of fields are performed explicitly.

    title: "DataSerializable",
    body: "## DataSerializable  As mentioned in the [Serializable &amp; Externalizable section](#serializable-externalizable), Java serialization is an easy mechanism. However, we do not have a control on how fields are serialized or deserialized. Moreover, this mechanism can lead to excessive CPU loads since it keeps track of objects to handle the cycles and streams class descriptors. These are performance decreasing factors; thus, serialized data may not have an optimal size.  The `DataSerializable` interface of Hazelcast overcomes these issues. Here is an example of a class implementing the `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.DataSerializable` interface.  ```java public class Address implements DataSerializable {   private String street;   private int zipCode;   private String city;   private String state;    public Address() {}    //getters setters..    public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out ) throws IOException {     out.writeUTF(street);     out.writeInt(zipCode);     out.writeUTF(city);     out.writeUTF(state);   }    public void readData( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException {     street = in.readUTF();     zipCode = in.readInt();     city = in.readUTF();     state = in.readUTF();   } } ```  Let's take a look at another example which encapsulates a `DataSerializable` field.   ```java public class Employee implements DataSerializable {   private String firstName;   private String lastName;   private int age;   private double salary;   private Address address; //address itself is DataSerializable    public Employee() {}    //getters setters..    public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out ) throws IOException {     out.writeUTF(firstName);     out.writeUTF(lastName);     out.writeInt(age);     out.writeDouble (salary);     address.writeData (out);   }    public void readData( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException {     firstName = in.readUTF();     lastName = in.readUTF();     age = in.readInt();     salary = in.readDouble();     address = new Address();     // since Address is DataSerializable let it read its own internal state     address.readData(in);   } } ```  As you can see, since `address` field itself is `DataSerializable`, it is calling `address.writeData(out)` when writing and `address.readData(in)` when reading. Also note that, the order of writing and reading fields should be the same. While Hazelcast serializes a `DataSerializable`, it writes the `className` first. When Hazelcast de-serializes it, `className` is used to instantiate the object using reflection.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Since Hazelcast needs to create an instance during deserialization,`DataSerializable` class has a no-arg constructor.*  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *`DataSerializable` is a good option if serialization is only needed for in-cluster communication.*   "

    title: "IdentifiedDataSerializable",
    body: "### IdentifiedDataSerializable  For a faster serialization of objects, avoiding reflection and long class names, Hazelcast recommends you implement `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.IdentifiedDataSerializable` which is a slightly better version of `DataSerializable`.  `DataSerializable` uses reflection to create a class instance, as mentioned in the [DataSerializable section](#dataserializable). But, `IdentifiedDataSerializable` uses a factory for this purpose and it is faster during deserialization which requires new instance creations.  `IdentifiedDataSerializable` extends `DataSerializable` and introduces two new methods.  -   `int getId();` -   `int getFactoryId();`   `IdentifiedDataSerializable` uses `getId()` instead of class name, and it uses `getFactoryId()` to load the class when given the Id. To complete the implementation, `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.DataSerializableFactory` should also be implemented and registered into `SerializationConfig` which can be accessed from `Config.getSerializationConfig()`. Factory's responsibility is to return an instance of the right `IdentifiedDataSerializable` object, given the Id. So far this is the most efficient way of Serialization that Hazelcast supports off the shelf.  Let's take a look at the example code below and configuration to see `IdentifiedDataSerializable` in action.  ```java public class Employee     implements IdentifiedDataSerializable {         private String surname;      public Employee() {}      public Employee( String surname ) {      this.surname = surname;   }      @Override   public void readData( ObjectDataInput in )        throws IOException {     this.surname = in.readUTF();   }      @Override   public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out )       throws IOException {      out.writeUTF( surname );   }      @Override   public int getFactoryId() {      return EmployeeDataSerializableFactory.FACTORY_ID;   }      @Override   public int getId() {      return EmployeeDataSerializableFactory.EMPLOYEE_TYPE;   }       @Override   public String toString() {     return String.format( \&quot;Employee(surname=%s)\&quot;, surname );    } } ```   The methods `getId` and `getFactoryId` return a unique positive number within the `EmployeeDataSerializableFactory`. Now, let's create an instance of this `EmployeeDataSerializableFactory`.  ```java public class EmployeeDataSerializableFactory      implements DataSerializableFactory{       public static final int FACTORY_ID = 1;       public static final int EMPLOYEE_TYPE = 1;    @Override   public IdentifiedDataSerializable create(int typeId) {     if ( typeId == EMPLOYEE_TYPE ) {        return new Employee();     } else {       return null;      }   } } ```  The only method that should be implemented is `create`, as seen in the above example. It is recommended that you use a `switch`-``case` statement instead of multiple `if`-`else` blocks if you have a lot of subclasses. Hazelcast throws an exception if null is returned for `typeId`.  As the last step, you need to register `EmployeeDataSerializableFactory` declaratively (declare in the configuration file `hazelcast.xml`) as shown below. Note that `factory-id` has the same value of `FACTORY_ID` in the above code. This is crucial to enable Hazelcast to find the correct factory.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;    ...   &lt;serialization&gt;     &lt;data-serializable-factories&gt;       &lt;data-serializable-factory         factory-id=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;EmployeeDataSerializableFactory       &lt;/data-serializable-factory&gt;     &lt;/data-serializable-factories&gt;   &lt;/serialization&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ***RELATED INFORMATION***   *Please refer to the [Serialization Configuration section](#serialization-configuration) for a full description of Hazelcast Serialization configuration.*         "

    url: "hazelcast-documentation.html#portable",
    title: "Portable",
    body: "## Portable  As an alternative to the existing serialization methods, Hazelcast offers a language/platform independent Portable serialization that has the following advantages:  -   Supports multi-version of the same object type. -   Fetches individual fields without having to rely on reflection. -   Queries and indexing support without de-serialization and/or reflection.  In order to support these features, a serialized Portable object contains meta information like the version and the concrete location of the each field in the binary data. This way, Hazelcast navigates in the `byte[]` and de-serializes only the required field without actually de-serializing the whole object. This improves the Query performance.  With multi-version support, you can have two nodes where each of them have different versions of the same object. Hazelcast will store both meta information and use the correct one to serialize and de-serialize Portable objects depending on the node. This is very helpful when you are doing a rolling upgrade without shutting down the cluster.  Portable serialization is totally language independent and is used as the binary protocol between Hazelcast server and clients.  A sample Portable implementation of a Foo class would look like the following.  ```java public class Foo implements Portable{   final static int ID = 5;    private String foo;    public String getFoo() {     return foo;   }    public void setFoo( String foo ) {     this.foo = foo;   }    @Override   public int getFactoryId() {     return 1;   }    @Override   public int getClassId() {     return ID;   }    @Override   public void writePortable( PortableWriter writer ) throws IOException {     writer.writeUTF( \&quot;foo\&quot;, foo );   }    @Override   public void readPortable( PortableReader reader ) throws IOException {     foo = reader.readUTF( \&quot;foo\&quot; );   } }         ```  Similar to `IdentifiedDataSerializable`, a Portable Class must provide `classId` and`factoryId`. The Factory object will create the Portable object given the `classId`.  An example `Factory` could be implemented as following:  ```java public class MyPortableFactory implements PortableFactory {    @Override   public Portable create( int classId ) {     if ( Foo.ID == classId )       return new Foo();     else       return null;   } }             ```  The last step is to register the `Factory` to the `SerializationConfig`. Below are the programmatic and declarative configurations for this step.   ```java Config config = new Config(); config.getSerializationConfig().addPortableFactory( 1, new MyPortableFactory() ); ```   ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;serialization&gt;     &lt;portable-version&gt;0&lt;/portable-version&gt;     &lt;portable-factories&gt;       &lt;portable-factory factory-id=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;           com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.MyPortableFactory       &lt;/portable-factory&gt;     &lt;/portable-factories&gt;   &lt;/serialization&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```   Note that the `id` that is passed to the `SerializationConfig` is the same as the `factoryId` that the `Foo` class returns.

    body: "### Versions  More than one version of the same class may need to be serialized and deserialized.  For example, a client may have an older version of a class, and the node to which it is connected can have a newer version of the same class.   Portable serialization supports versioning. You can declare Version in the configuration file `hazelcast.xml` using the `portable-version` element, as shown below.  ```xml &lt;serialization&gt;   &lt;portable-version&gt;1&lt;/portable-version&gt;   &lt;portable-factories&gt;     &lt;portable-factory factory-id=\&quot;1\&quot;&gt;         PortableFactoryImpl     &lt;/portable-factory&gt;   &lt;/portable-factories&gt; &lt;/serialization&gt; ```  You should consider the following when you perform versioning.  - It is important to change the version whenever an update is performed in the serialized fields of a class (e.g. increment the version). - If a client performs a Portable deserialization on a field, and then that Portable is updated by removing that field on the cluster side, this may lead to a problem. - Portable serialization does not use reflection and hence, fields in the class and in the serialized content are not automatically mapped. Field renaming is a simpler process. Also, since the class ID is stored, renaming the Portable does not lead to problems. - Types of fields need to be updated carefully. Hazelcast performs basic type upgradings (e.g. `int` to `float`).  "

There are two solutions to get rid of this exception. Either put a non-null portable class of the same type before any other operation, or manually register a class definition in serialization configuration as shown below.  ```java Config config = new Config(); final ClassDefinition classDefinition = new ClassDefinitionBuilder(Foo.factoryId, Foo.getClassId)                        .addUTFField(\&quot;foo\&quot;).build(); config.getSerializationConfig().addClassDefinition(classDefinition); Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); ```   "

For instance, if your distributed object is an instance of `IQueue`, you can either use `HazelcastInstance.getQueue(id)` or `Hazelcast.getDistributedObject`.  You can use the `HazelcastInstanceAware` interface in the case of a deserialization of a Portable DistributedObject if it gets an ID to be looked up.

Just make sure the fields are read in the same order as they are written. The type ID must be unique and greater than or equal to **1**. Uniqueness of the type ID enables Hazelcast to determine which serializer will be used during deserialization.

First we need to implement a `com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.StreamSerializer`. A very simple one that uses XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder could look like the following:  ```java public static class FooXmlSerializer implements StreamSerializer&lt;Foo&gt; {    @Override   public int getTypeId() {     return 10;   }    @Override   public void write( ObjectDataOutput out, Foo object ) throws IOException {     ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();     XMLEncoder encoder = new XMLEncoder( bos );     encoder.writeObject( object );     encoder.close();     out.write( bos.toByteArray() );   }    @Override   public Foo read( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException {     InputStream inputStream = (InputStream) in;     XMLDecoder decoder = new XMLDecoder( inputStream );     return (Foo) decoder.readObject();   }    @Override   public void destroy() {   } } ```  Note that `typeId` must be unique because Hazelcast will use it to look up the `StreamSerializer` while it de-serializes the object. The last required step is to register the `StreamSerializer` to the Configuration. Below are the programmatic and declarative configurations for this step.  ```java SerializerConfig sc = new SerializerConfig()     .setImplementation(new FooXmlSerializer())     .setTypeClass(Foo.class); Config config = new Config(); config.getSerializationConfig().addSerializerConfig(sc); ```   ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;serialization&gt;     &lt;serializers&gt;       &lt;serializer type-class=\&quot;com.www.Foo\&quot;&gt;com.www.FooXmlSerializer&lt;/serializer&gt;     &lt;/serializers&gt;   &lt;/serialization&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  From now on, Hazelcast will use `FooXmlSerializer` to serialize Foo objects.

Notice the `hazelcastInstance` is `transient`. This is because this field should not be serialized.  It may be a good practice to inject a HazelcastInstance into a domain object (e.g. `Employee` in the above sample) when used together with `Runnable`/`Callable` implementations. These runnables/callables are executed by `IExecutorService` which sends them to another machine. And after a task is deserialized, run/call method implementations need to access HazelcastInstance.  We recommend you only to set the HazelcastInstance field while using `setHazelcastInstance` method and not to execute operations on the HazelcastInstance. Because, when HazelcastInstance is injected for a `HazelcastInstanceAware` implementation, it may not be up and running at the injection time.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;     "

    title: "Cluster-Member Safety Check",
    body: "### Cluster-Member Safety Check  To prevent data loss when shutting down a node, Hazelcast provides a graceful shutdown feature. You perform this by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`. Once this method is called, it checks the following conditions to ensure the node is safe to shutdown.  - There is no active migration. - At least one backup of partitions are synced with primary ones.  Even if the above conditions are not met, `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()` will force them to be completed. Eventually, when this method returns, it means the node has been brought to a safe state and it can be shut down without any data loss.   What if you want to be sure that your **cluster** is in a safe state? What does it mean that cluster is safe to shutdown without any data loss?   There may be some use cases like rolling upgrades, development/testing or any logic that require a cluster/member to be safe. To provide this, Hazelcast offers the `PartitionService` interface with the methods `isClusterSafe`, `isMemberSafe`, `isLocalMemberSafe` and `forceLocalMemberToBeSafe`. These methods can be deemed as decoupled pieces from the method `Hazelcast.shutdown`.    ```java public interface PartitionService {    ...    ...     boolean isClusterSafe();     boolean isMemberSafe(Member member);     boolean isLocalMemberSafe();     boolean forceLocalMemberToBeSafe(long timeout, TimeUnit unit); } ```  The method `isClusterSafe` checks whether the cluster is in a safe state. It returns `true` if there are no active partition migrations and there are sufficient backups for each partition. Once it returns `true`, the cluster is safe and a node can be shut down without data loss.  The method `isMemberSafe` checks whether a specific node is in a safe state. This check controls if the first backups of partitions of the given node are synced with the primary ones. Once it returns `true`, the given node is safe and it can be shut down without data loss. Similarly, the method `isLocalMemberSafe` does the same check for the local member. The method `forceLocalMemberToBeSafe` forces the owned and backup partitions to be synchronized, making the local member safe.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *These methods are available from Hazelcast 3.3.*   "

If the number of machines is below the defined minimum at any time, the operations are rejected and the rejected operations return a `QuorumException` to their callers.  When a network partitioning happens, by default Hazelcast chooses to be available. With Cluster Quorum, you can tune your Hazelcast instance towards to achieve better consistency, by rejecting updates with a minimum threshold, this reduces the chance that number of concurrent updates to an entry from two partitioned clusters . Note that the consistency defined here is best effort not full or strong consistency.  Hazelcast initiates a quorum when a change happens on the member list.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Currently cluster quorum only applies to the Map and Transactional Map, support for other data structures will be added soon.

You can either deploy the `mancenter`-*version*`.war` application into your Java application server/container or you can start Hazelcast Management Center from the command line and then have the Hazelcast nodes communicate with that web application. This means that your Hazelcast nodes should know the URL of the `mancenter` application before they start.  Here are the steps:  -	Download the latest Hazelcast ZIP from [hazelcast.org](http://www.hazelcast.org/download/). The ZIP contains the `mancenter`-*version*`.war` file.  -	You can directly start `mancenter`-*version*`.war` file from the command line. The following command will start Hazelcast Management Center on port 8080 with context root 'mancenter' (`http://localhost:8080/mancenter`).  ```java java -jar mancenter-*version*.war 8080 mancenter ```  -	Or, you can deploy it to your web server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.). Let us say it is running at `http://localhost:8080/mancenter`. -	After you perform the above steps, make sure that `http://localhost:8080/mancenter` is up. -	Configure your Hazelcast nodes by adding the URL of your web application to your `hazelcast.xml`. Hazelcast nodes will send their states to this URL.  ```xml &lt;management-center enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;   http://localhost:8080/mancenter &lt;/management-center&gt; ```  -	Start your Hazelcast cluster. -	Browse to `http://localhost:8080/mancenter` and login. **Initial login username/password is `admin/admin`**  The Management Center creates a folder with the name \&quot;mancenter\&quot; under your \&quot;user/home\&quot; folder to save data files. You can change the data folder by setting the `hazelcast.mancenter.home` system property.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *Please refer to the [Management Center Configuration section](#management-center-configuration) for a full description of Hazelcast Management Center configuration.*   "

After you write your script and press the **Execute** button, you can see the execution result in the **Result** part of the window.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *To use the scripting languages other than JavaScript on a member, the libraries for those languages should be placed in the classpath of that member.*  There are **Save** and **Delete** buttons on the top right of the scripting editor. To save your scripts, press the **Save** button after you type a name for your script into the field next to this button. The scripts you saved are listed in the **Saved Scripts** part of the window, located at the bottom right of the page. Click on a saved script from this list to execute or edit it. If you want to remove a script that you wrote and saved before, select it from this list and press the **Delete** button.  In the scripting engine you have a `HazelcastInstance` bonded to a variable named `hazelcast`. You can invoke any method that `HazelcastInstance` has via the `hazelcast` variable. You can see example usage for JavaScript below.  ```javascript var name = hazelcast.getName(); var node = hazelcast.getCluster().getLocalMember(); var employees = hazelcast.getMap(\&quot;employees\&quot;); employees.put(\&quot;1\&quot;,\&quot;John Doe\&quot;); employees.get(\&quot;1\&quot;); // will return \&quot;John Doe\&quot; ```   "

The next screen asks for which data structure (maps, queues, multimaps, executors) the alert will be created. Once a structure is selected, the next screen immediately loads and you then select the data structure instances (i.e. if you selected *Maps*, it will list all the maps defined in the cluster, you can select one map or more). Select as desired, click on the **Next** button, and select the members on which the selected data structure instances will run.  The next screen, as shown below, is the one where you specify the criteria for the selected data structure.  ![](images/DataAlert1.jpg)  As the screen shown above shows, you will select an item from the left combo box, select the operator in the middle one, specify a value in the input field, and click on the **Add** button. You can create more than one criteria in this page; those will be bound by the logical operator **AND**.  After you specify the criteria and click the **Next** button, give a name for the filter, select whether notification e-mails will be sent (to no one, only admin or to all users) and select whether the alert data will be written to the disk (if checked, you can see the alert log at the folder */users/&lt;your user&gt;/mancenter&lt;version&gt;*).  Click on the **Save** button; your filter will be saved and put into the **Filters** part of the page. To edit the filter, click on the ![](images/EditIcon.jpg) icon.

You can go back in time using the slider and/or calendar and check your cluster's situation at the selected time. All data structures and members can be monitored as if you are using the management center normally (charts and data tables for each data structure and members). Using the arrow buttons placed at both sides of the slider, you can go back or further with steps of 5 seconds. It will show status if Time Travel has been **ON** at the selected time in past; otherwise, all the charts and tables will be shown as empty.  The historical data collected with Time Travel feature are stored in a file database on the disk. These files can be found in the folder `&lt;User's Home Directory&gt;/mancenter&lt;Hazelcast version&gt;`, e.g. `/home/mancenter3.5`. This folder can be changed using the `hazelcast.mancenter.home` property on the server where Management Center is running.  Time travel data files are created monthly. Their file name format is `[group-name]-[year][month].db` and  `[group-name]-[year][month].lg`. Time travel data is kept in the `*.db` files. The files with the extension `lg` are temporary files created internally and you do not have to worry about them.

Encryption is based on [Java Cryptography Architecture](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html). In symmetric encryption, each node uses the same key, so the key is shared. Here is an example configuration for symmetric encryption.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;network&gt;     ...     &lt;!--       Make sure to set enabled=true       Make sure this configuration is exactly the same on       all members     --&gt;     &lt;symmetric-encryption enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;       &lt;!--         encryption algorithm such as         DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding,         PBEWithMD5AndDES,         Blowfish,         DESede       --&gt;       &lt;algorithm&gt;PBEWithMD5AndDES&lt;/algorithm&gt;        &lt;!-- salt value to use when generating the secret key --&gt;       &lt;salt&gt;thesalt&lt;/salt&gt;        &lt;!-- pass phrase to use when generating the secret key --&gt;       &lt;password&gt;thepass&lt;/password&gt;        &lt;!-- iteration count to use when generating the secret key --&gt;       &lt;iteration-count&gt;19&lt;/iteration-count&gt;     &lt;/symmetric-encryption&gt;   &lt;/network&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/br&gt;   ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *Please see the [SSL section](#ssl).*     "

You define `keyStore` and `keyStorePassword`, and you can set `keyManagerAlgorithm` (default `SunX509`), `trustManagerAlgorithm` (default `SunX509`) and `protocol` (default `TLS`).  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;network&gt;     ...     &lt;ssl enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;       &lt;factory-class-name&gt;           com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.BasicSSLContextFactory       &lt;/factory-class-name&gt;       &lt;properties&gt;         &lt;property name=\&quot;keyStore\&quot;&gt;keyStore&lt;/property&gt;         &lt;property name=\&quot;keyStorePassword\&quot;&gt;keyStorePassword&lt;/property&gt;         &lt;property name=\&quot;keyManagerAlgorithm\&quot;&gt;SunX509&lt;/property&gt;         &lt;property name=\&quot;trustManagerAlgorithm\&quot;&gt;SunX509&lt;/property&gt;         &lt;property name=\&quot;protocol\&quot;&gt;TLS&lt;/property&gt;       &lt;/properties&gt;     &lt;/ssl&gt;   &lt;/network&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  Hazelcast client also has SSL support. You can configure Client SSL programmatically as shown below.  ```java Properties props = new Properties(); ... ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig(); config.getSocketOptions().setSocketFactory( new SSLSocketFactory( props ) ); ```  You can also set `keyStore` and `keyStorePassword` with the following system properties.   - `javax.net.ssl.keyStore`  - `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword`   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *You cannot use SSL when [Hazelcast Encryption](#encryption) is enabled.*      "

Credentials is an interface which extends `Serializable` and has three methods to implement. You can either implement the `Credentials` interface or extend the `AbstractCredentials` class, which is an abstract implementation of `Credentials`.  ```java package com.hazelcast.security; public interface Credentials extends Serializable {   String getEndpoint();   void setEndpoint( String endpoint ) ;       String getPrincipal() ;     } ```  Hazelcast calls the `Credentials.setEndpoint()` method when an authentication request arrives at the node before authentication takes place.  ```java package com.hazelcast.security; ... public abstract class AbstractCredentials implements Credentials, DataSerializable {   private transient String endpoint;   private String principal;   ... } ```  `UsernamePasswordCredentials`, a custom implementation of Credentials, is in the Hazelcast `com.hazelcast.security` package. `UsernamePasswordCredentials` is used for default configuration during the authentication process of both members and clients.  ```java package com.hazelcast.security; ... public class UsernamePasswordCredentials extends Credentials {   private byte[] password;   ... } ```      "

User supplied attributes from `LoginModule`s are accessed by [CallbackHandler](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/security/auth/callback/CallbackHandler.html)s. To access the `Credentials` object, Hazelcast uses its own specialized `CallbackHandler`. During initialization of `LoginModules`, Hazelcast passes this special `CallbackHandler` into the `LoginModule.initialize()` method.  `LoginModule` implementations should create an instance of `com.hazelcast.security.CredentialsCallback` and call the `handle(Callback[] callbacks)` method of `CallbackHandler` during the login process.   `CredentialsCallback.getCredentials()` returns the supplied `Credentials` object.  ```java public class CustomLoginModule implements LoginModule {   CallbackHandler callbackHandler;   Subject subject;        public void initialize( Subject subject, CallbackHandler callbackHandler,                           Map&lt;String, ?&gt; sharedState, Map&lt;String, ?&gt; options ) {     this.subject = subject;     this.callbackHandler = callbackHandler;   }    public final boolean login() throws LoginException {     CredentialsCallback callback = new CredentialsCallback();     try {       callbackHandler.handle( new Callback[] { callback } );       credentials = cb.getCredentials();     } catch ( Exception e ) {       throw new LoginException( e.getMessage() );     }     ...   }   ... } ```  To use the default Hazelcast permission policy, you must create an instance of `com.hazelcast.security.ClusterPrincipal` that holds the `Credentials` object, and you must add it to `Subject.principals onLoginModule.commit()` as shown below.  ```java public class MyCustomLoginModule implements LoginModule {   ...   public boolean commit() throws LoginException {     ...     Principal principal = new ClusterPrincipal( credentials );     subject.getPrincipals().add( principal );              return true;   }   ... } ```  Hazelcast has an abstract implementation of `LoginModule` that does callback and cleanup operations and holds the resulting `Credentials` instance. `LoginModule`s extending `ClusterLoginModule` can access `Credentials`, `Subject`, `LoginModule` instances and options, and `sharedState` maps. Extending the `ClusterLoginModule` is recommended instead of implementing all required stuff.  ```java package com.hazelcast.security; ... public abstract class ClusterLoginModule implements LoginModule {    protected abstract boolean onLogin() throws LoginException;   protected abstract boolean onCommit() throws LoginException;   protected abstract boolean onAbort() throws LoginException;   protected abstract boolean onLogout() throws LoginException; } ``` &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

The following operations will be routed to the same member, since all of them are operating based on the same key `\&quot;key1\&quot;`.  ```java HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map mapA = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;mapA\&quot; ); Map mapB = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;mapB\&quot; ); Map mapC = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;mapC\&quot; );  // since map names are different, operation will be manipulating // different entries, but the operation will take place on the // same member since the keys (\&quot;key1\&quot;) are the same mapA.put( \&quot;key1\&quot;, value ); mapB.get( \&quot;key1\&quot; ); mapC.remove( \&quot;key1\&quot; );  // lock operation will still execute on the same member // of the cluster since the key (\&quot;key1\&quot;) is same hazelcastInstance.getLock( \&quot;key1\&quot; ).lock();  // distributed execution will execute the 'runnable' on the // same member since \&quot;key1\&quot; is passed as the key.    hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService().executeOnKeyOwner( runnable, \&quot;key1\&quot; ); ```  When the keys are the same, entries are stored on the same node. But we sometimes want to have related entries stored on the same node, such as a customer and his/her order entries. We would have a customers map with customerId as the key and an orders map with orderId as the key. Since customerId and orderId are different keys, a customer and his/her orders may fall into different members/nodes in your cluster. So how can we have them stored on the same node? We create an affinity between customer and orders. If we make them part of the same partition then these entries will be co-located. We achieve this by making orderIds `PartitionAware`.  ```java public class OrderKey implements Serializable, PartitionAware {    private final long customerId;   private final long orderId;    public OrderKey( long orderId, long customerId ) {     this.customerId = customerId;     this.orderId = orderId;   }    public long getCustomerId() {     return customerId;   }    public long getOrderId() {     return orderId;   }    public Object getPartitionKey() {     return customerId;   }    @Override   public String toString() {     return \&quot;OrderKey{\&quot;       + \&quot;customerId=\&quot; + customerId       + \&quot;, orderId=\&quot; + orderId       + '}';   } } ```  Notice that OrderKey implements `PartitionAware` and that `getPartitionKey()` returns the `customerId`. This will make sure that the `Customer` entry and its `Order`s will be stored on the same node.  ```java HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map mapCustomers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; ); Map mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;orders\&quot; );  // create the customer entry with customer id = 1 mapCustomers.put( 1, customer );  // now create the orders for this customer mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 21, 1 ), order ); mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 22, 1 ), order ); mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 23, 1 ), order ); ```  Assume that you have a customers map where `customerId` is the key and the customer object is the value. You want to remove one of the customer orders and return the number of remaining orders. Here is how you would normally do it.  ```java public static int removeOrder( long customerId, long orderId ) throws Exception {   IMap&lt;Long, Customer&gt; mapCustomers = instance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );   IMap mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;orders\&quot; );    mapCustomers.lock( customerId );   mapOrders.remove( orderId );   Set orders = orderMap.keySet(Predicates.equal( \&quot;customerId\&quot;, customerId ));   mapCustomers.unlock( customerId );    return orders.size(); } ```  There are couple of things you should consider.  1. There are four distributed operations there: lock, remove, keySet, unlock. Can you reduce  the number of distributed operations? 2. The customer object may not be that big, but can you not have to pass that object through the  wire? Think about a scenario where you set order count to the customer object for fast access, so you  should do a get and a put, and as a result, the customer object is passed through the wire twice.  Instead, why not move the computation over to the member (JVM) where your customer data resides. Here is how you can do this with distributed executor service.  1. Send a `PartitionAware` `Callable` task. 2. `Callable` does the deletion of the order right there and returns with the remaining  order count. 3. Upon completion of the `Callable` task, return the result (remaining order count). You  do not have to wait until the task is completed; since distributed executions are asynchronous, you can do other things in the meantime.  Here is some example code.  ```java HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();  public int removeOrder( long customerId, long orderId ) throws Exception {   IExecutorService executorService     = hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService( \&quot;ExecutorService\&quot; );      OrderDeletionTask task = new OrderDeletionTask( customerId, orderId );   Future&lt;Integer&gt; future = executorService.submit( task );   int remainingOrders = future.get();      return remainingOrders; }  public static class OrderDeletionTask     implements Callable&lt;Integer&gt;, PartitionAware, Serializable {    private long customerId;   private long orderId;    public OrderDeletionTask() {   }    public OrderDeletionTask(long customerId, long orderId) {     super();     this.customerId = customerId;     this.orderId = orderId;   }    @Override   public Integer call() {     Map&lt;Long, Customer&gt; customerMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;customers\&quot; );     IMap&lt;OrderKey, Order&gt; orderMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap( \&quot;orders\&quot; );          mapCustomers.lock( customerId );     Customer customer = mapCustomers.get( customerId );     Predicate predicate = Predicates.equal( \&quot;customerId\&quot;, customerId );     Set&lt;OrderKey&gt; orderKeys = orderMap.localKeySet( predicate );     int orderCount = orderKeys.size();     for (OrderKey key : orderKeys) {       if (key.orderId == orderId) {         orderCount--;         orderMap.delete( key );       }     }     mapCustomers.unlock( customerId );          return orderCount;   }    @Override   public Object getPartitionKey() {     return customerId;   } } ```  The benefits of doing the same operation with distributed `ExecutorService` based on the key are:  - Only one distributed execution (`executorService.submit(task)`), instead of four. - Less data is sent over the wire. - Since lock/update/unlock cycle is done locally (local to the customer data), lock duration for the `Customer` entry is much less, thus enabling higher concurrency.

index.add({
    url: "hazelcast-documentation.html#back-pressure",
    title: "Back Pressure",
    body: "## Back Pressure  Hazelcast uses operations to make remote calls. For example, a `map.get` is an operation and a `map.put` is one operation for the primary  and one operation for each of the backups, i.e. `map.put` is executed for the primary and also for each backup. In most cases, there will be a natural balance between the number of threads performing operations and the number of operations being executed. However, there are two situations where this balance and operations  can pile up and eventually lead to Out of Memory Exception (OOME):  - Asynchronous calls: With async calls, the system may be flooded with the requests.  - Asynchronous backups: The asynchronous backups may be piling up.  To prevent the system from crashing, Hazelcast provides back pressure. Back pressure works by:   - limiting the number of concurrent operation invocations,   - periodically making an async backup sync.  Back pressure is disabled by default and you can enable it using the following system property:  `hazelcast.backpressure.enabled`  To control the number of concurrent invocations, you can configure the number of invocations allowed per partition using the  following system property:  `hazelcast.backpressure.max.concurrent.invocations.per.partition`  The default value of this system property is 100. Using a default configuration a system is allowed to have (271 + 1) * 100 = 27200 concurrent invocations (271 partitions + 1 for generic operations).   Back pressure is only applied to normal operations. System operations like heart beats and partition migration operations  are not influenced by back pressure. 27200 invocations might seem like a lot, but keep in mind that executing a task on `IExecutor`  or acquiring a lock also requires an operation.  If the maximum number of invocations has been reached, Hazelcast will automatically apply an exponential back off policy. This gives the system some time to deal with the load. Using the following system property, you can configure the maximum time to wait before a `HazelcastOverloadException` is thrown:  `hazelcast.backpressure.backoff.timeout.millis`  This system property's default value is 60000 ms.  The Health Monitor keeps an eye on the usage of the invocations. If it sees a member has consumed 70% or more of the invocations, it starts to log health messages.  Apart from controlling the number of invocations, you also need to control the number of pending async backups. This is done by periodically making these backups sync instead of async. This forces all pending backups to get drained. For this, Hazelcast tracks the number of asynchronous backups for each partition. At every **Nth** call, one synchronization is forced. This **N** is  controlled through the following property:  `hazelcast.backpressure.syncwindow`  This system property's default value is 100. It means, out of 100 *asynchronous* backups, Hazelcast makes 1 of them a *synchronous* one. A randomization is added, so the sync window with default configuration will be between 75 and 125  invocations.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  ***RELATED INFORMATION***  *Please refer to the [System Properties section](#system-properties) to learn how to configure the system properties.*    "

You can configure the number of IO-threads using the `hazelcast.io.thread.count` system property. Its default value is 3 per member.

    body: "### Event Threading  Hazelcast uses a shared event system to deal with components that rely on events, such as topic, collections, listeners, and Near Cache.   Each cluster member has an array of event threads and each thread has its own work queue. When an event is produced, either locally or remotely, an event thread is selected (depending on if there is a message ordering) and the event is placed in the work queue for that event thread.  The following properties can be set to alter the behavior of the system.  * `hazelcast.event.thread.count`: Number of event-threads in this array. Its default value is 5. * `hazelcast.event.queue.capacity`: Capacity of the work queue. Its default value is 1000000. * `hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis`: Timeout for placing an item on the work queue. Its default value is 250.  If you process a lot of events and have many cores, changing the value of `hazelcast.event.thread.count` property to a higher value is a good idea. This way, more events can be processed in parallel.  Multiple components share the same event queues. If there are 2 topics, say A and B, for certain messages they may share the same queue(s) and hence the same event thread. If there are a lot of pending messages produced by A, then B needs to wait. Also, when processing a message from A takes a lot of time and the event thread is used for that, B will suffer from this.  That is why it is better to offload processing to a dedicated thread (pool) so that systems are better isolated.  If events are produced at a higher rate than they are consumed, the queue will grow in size. To prevent overloading the system and running into an `OutOfMemoryException`, the queue is given a capacity of 1 million items. When the maximum capacity is reached, the items are dropped. This means that the event system is a 'best effort' system. There is no guarantee that you are going to get an event. Topic A might have a lot of pending messages, and therefore B cannot receive messages because the queue has no capacity and messages for B are dropped.      "

    body: "#### Partition-aware Operations  To execute partition-aware operations, an array of operation threads is created. The size of this array has a default value of two times the number of cores and a minimum value of 2. This value can be changed using the `hazelcast.operation.thread.count` property.  Each operation-thread has its own work queue and it will consume messages from this work queue. If a partition-aware  operation needs to be scheduled, the right thread is found using the formula below.  `threadIndex = partitionId % partition-thread-count`  After the `threadIndex` is determined, the operation is put in the work queue of that operation-thread. This means that:   * a single operation thread executes operations for multiple partitions; if there are 271 partitions and  10 partition-threads, then roughly every operation-thread will execute operations for 27 partitions.    * each partition belongs to only 1 operation thread. All operations for a partition will always   be handled by exactly the same operation-thread.    * no concurrency control is needed to deal with partition-aware operations because once a partition-aware  operation is put on the work queue of a partition-aware operation thread, only   1 thread is able to touch that partition.  Because of this threading strategy, there are two forms of false sharing you need to be aware of:  * false sharing of the partition: two completely independent data structures share the same partitions; e.g. if there  is a map `employees` and a map `orders`, the method `employees.get(\&quot;peter\&quot;)` running on partition 25 may be blocked  by a `map.get()` of `orders.get(1234)` also running on partition 25. If independent data structure share the same partition,  a slow operation on one data structure can slow down the other data structures.   * false sharing of the partition-aware operation-thread: each operation-thread is responsible for executing  operations of a number of partitions. For example, thread-1 could be responsible for partitions 0,10,20,... thread-2 for partitions  1,11,21,... etc. If an operation for partition 1 takes a lot of time, it will block the execution of an operation of partition  11 because both of them are mapped to exactly the same operation-thread.  You need to be careful with long running operations because you could starve operations of a thread.  As a general rule, the partition thread should be released as soon as possible because operations are not designed to execute long running operations. That is why, for example, it is very dangerous to execute a long running operation  using `AtomicReference.alter()` or an `IMap.executeOnKey()`, because these operations will block other operations to be executed.  Currently, there is no support for work stealing. Different partitions that map to the same thread may need to wait  till one of the partitions is finished, even though there are other free partition-operation threads available.  **Example:**  Take a 3 node cluster. Two members will have 90 primary partitions and one member will have 91 primary partitions. Let's say you have one CPU and 4 cores per CPU. By default, 8 operation threads will be allocated to serve 90 or 91 partitions.  "

It can be changed using the  `hazelcast.operation.generic.thread.count` property. This means that:  * a non partition-aware operation-thread will never execute an operation for a specific partition. Only partition-aware   operation-threads execute partition-aware operations.   Unlike the partition-aware operation threads, all the generic operation threads share the same work queue: `genericWorkQueue`.  If a non partition-aware operation needs to be executed, it is placed in that work queue and any generic operation  thread can execute it. The big advantage is that you automatically have work balancing since any generic operation  thread is allowed to pick up work from this queue.  The disadvantage is that this shared queue can be a point of contention.

It will always check this priority queue before it processes work from its normal work queue.  * For non partition-aware operations: next to the `genericWorkQueue`, there also is a `genericPriorityWorkQueue`. So when a priority operation  needs to be executed, it is put in this `genericPriorityWorkQueue`. And just like the partition-aware operation threads, a generic  operation thread will first check the `genericPriorityWorkQueue` for work.    Because a worker thread will block on the normal work queue (either partition specific or generic), a priority operation may not be picked up because it will not be put on the queue where it is blocking.

In terms of the latency, AWS cloud performance is not the same for each region. There are vast differences in the speed and optimization from region to region.  When you do not pay attention to AWS regions, Hazelcast applications may run tens or even hundreds of times slower than necessary. The following notes are potential workarounds.  - Create a cluster only within a region. It is not recommended that you deploy a single cluster that spans across multiple regions. - If a Hazelcast application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple EC2 regions, you can reduce the latency by serving the end users` requests from the EC2 region which has the lowest network latency. Changes in network connectivity and routing result in changes in the latency between hosts on the Internet. Amazon has a web service (Route 53) that lets the cloud architects use DNS to route end-user requests to the EC2 region that gives the fastest response. This latency-based routing is based on latency measurements performed over a period of time. Please have a look at [Route53](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/HowDoesRoute53Work.html). - Move the deployment to another region. The [CloudPing](http://www.cloudping.info/) tool gives instant estimates on the latency from your location. By using it frequently, CloudPing can be helpful to determine the regions which have the lowest latency. - The [SpeedTest](http://cloudharmony.com/speedtest) tool allows you to test the network latency and also the downloading/uploading speeds.

    body: "# Hazelcast Simulator  Hazelcast Simulator is a production simulator used to test Hazelcast and Hazelcast-based applications in clustered environments. It also allows you to create your own tests and perform them on your Hazelcast clusters and applications that are deployed to cloud computing environments. In your tests, you can provide any property that can be specified on these environments (Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine(GCE), or your own environment): properties such as hardware specifications, operating system, Java version, etc.  Hazelcast Simulator allows you to add potential production problems, such as real-life failures, network problems, overloaded CPU, and failing nodes to your tests. It also provides a benchmarking and performance testing platform by supporting performance tracking and also supporting various out-of-the-box profilers.  Hazelcast Simulator makes use of Apache jclouds&amp;reg;, an open source multi-cloud toolkit that is primarily designed for testing on the clouds like Amazon EC2 and GCE.  You can use Hazelcast Simulator for the following use cases:  - In your pre-production phase to simulate the expected throughput/latency of Hazelcast with your specific requirements. - To test if Hazelcast behaves as expected when you implement a new functionality in your project. - As part of your test suite in your deployment process. - When you upgrade your Hazelcast version.  Hazelcast Simulator is available as a downloadable package on the Hazelcast [web site](http://www.hazelcast.org/download). Please refer to the [Installing Simulator section](#installing-simulator) for more information.  "

    title: "Key Concepts",
    body: "## Key Concepts  The following are the key concepts mentioned with Hazelcast Simulator.  - **Test** -  A test class for the functionality you want to test, such as a Hazelcast map. This test class may seem like a JUnit test, but it uses custom annotations to define methods for different test phases (e.g. setup, warmup, run, verify).  - **TestSuite** -  A property file that contains the name of the test class and the properties you want to set on that test class instance. In most cases, a `TestSuite` contains a single test class, but you can configure multiple tests within a single `TestSuite`.  - **Failure** -  An indication that something has gone wrong. Failures are picked up by the `Agent` and sent back to the `Coordinator`. Please see the descriptions below for the `Agent` and `Coordinator`.  - **Worker** - A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) responsible for running a `TestSuite`. It can be configured to spawn a Hazelcast client or member instance.  - **Agent** - A JVM installed on a piece of hardware. Its main responsibility is spawning, monitoring and terminating `Workers`.  - **Coordinator** -  A JVM that can run anywhere, such as on your local machine. **Coordinator** is actually responsible for running the test using the `Agents`. You configure it with a list of `Agent` IP addresses, and you run it by sending a command like \&quot;run this testsuite with 10 worker JVMs for 2 hours\&quot;.  - **Provisioner** -  Spawns and terminates cloud instances, and installs `Agents` on the remote machines. It can be used in combination with EC2 (or any other cloud), but it can also be used in a static setup, such as a local machine or a cluster of machines in your data center.  - **Communicator** -  A JVM that enables the communication between the `Agents` and `Workers`.  - `simulator.properties` - The configuration file you use to adapt the Hazelcast Simulator to your business needs (e.g. cloud selection and configuration).

You should set the values for the following parameters that are included in this file.  - CLOUD_PROVIDER: Maven artifact ID of the cloud provider. In this case it is `aws-ec2` for Amazon EC2. Please refer to the [Simulator.Properties File Description section](#simulator-properties-file-description) for a full list of cloud providers. - CLOUD_IDENTITY: The path to the file that contains your EC2 access key.  - CLOUD_CREDENTIAL: The path to the file that contains your EC2 secret key.  - MACHINE_SPEC: The parameter by which you can specify the EC2 instance type, operating system of the instance, EC2 region, etc.   The following is an example of a `simulator.properties` file with the parameters explained above. For this example, you should have created the files `~/ec2.identity` and `~/ec2.credential` that contain your EC2 access key and secret key, respectively.  ``` CLOUD_PROVIDER=aws-ec2 CLOUD_IDENTITY=~/ec2.identity CLOUD_CREDENTIAL=~/ec2.credential MACHINE_SPEC=hardwareId=c3.xlarge,imageId=us-east-1/ami-1b3b2472 ```   ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE***: *Creating these files in your working folder instead of just setting the access and secret keys in the `simulator.properties` file is for security reasons.

You can send this message to Agents only. - `softKill` - Instructs a JVM that is running a message recipient to exit. - `spinCore` - Starts a new busy-spinning thread. You can use it to simulate increased CPU consumption. - `unblockTraffic` - Open ports blocked by the `blockHzTraffic` message. - `oom` - Forces a message recipient to use all memory and cause an OutOfMemoryError. - `terminateWorker` - Terminates a random Worker.

    body: "## Simulator.Properties File Description  The file `simulator.properties` is placed at the `conf` folder of your Hazelcast Simulator. This file is used to prepare the Simulator tests for their proper executions according to your business needs.  ![](images/NoteSmall.jpg)***NOTE:*** *Currently, the main focuses are on the Simulator tests of Hazelcast on Amazon EC2 and Google Compute Engine (GCE). For the preparation of `simulator.properties` for GCE, please refer to the [Setting Up For GCE section](#setting-up-for-google-compute-engine). The following `simulator.properties` file description is mainly for Amazon EC2.*  This file includes the following parameters.  - `CLOUD_PROVIDER`: The Maven artifact ID of your cloud provider. For example, it is `aws-ec2` if you are going to test your Hazelcast on Amazon EC2. For the full list of supported clouds, please refer to [http://jclouds.apache.org/reference/providers/](http://jclouds.apache.org/reference/providers/). - `CLOUD_IDENTITY`: The full path of the file containing your AWS access key. - `CLOUD_CREDENTIAL`: The full path of the file containing your AWS secret key.  - `CLOUD_POLL_INITIAL_PERIOD`: The time in milliseconds between the requests (polls) from jclouds&amp;reg; to your cloud. Its default value is `50`. - `CLOUD_POLL_MAX_PERIOD`: The maximum time in milliseconds between the polls to your cloud. Its default value is `1000`. - `CLOUD_BATCH_SIZE`: The number of machines to be started/terminated in one go. For Amazon EC2, its acceptable value is `20`. - `GROUP_NAME`: The prefix for the agent name. You may want to give different names for different test clusters. For GCE, you need to be very careful using multiple group names, since for every port and every group name, a firewall rule is made and you can only have 100 firewall rules. If the name contains `${username}`, this section will be replaced by the actual user that runs the test. This makes it very easy to identify which user owns a certain machine. - `USER`: The name of the user on your local machine. jclouds&amp;reg; automatically creates a new user on the remote machine with this name as the login name. It also copies the public key of your system to the remote machine and adds it to the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Therefore, once the instance is created, you can login with the command `ssh &lt;USER&gt;@&lt;IP address&gt;`. Its default value is `simulator`. - `SSH_OPTIONS`: The options added to SSH. You do not need to change these options. - `SECURITY_GROUP`: The name of the security group that includes the instances created for the Simulator test. For Amazon EC2, this group will be created automatically if it does not exist. If you do not specify a region for the parameter `MACHINE_SPEC` (using the `locationId` attribute), the region will be `us-east-1`. If a security group already exists, please make sure the ports 22, 9000, 9001 and the ports between 5701 and 5751 are open. For GCE, this parameter is not used. - `SUBNET_ID`: The VPC Subnet ID for Amazon EC2. If this value is different from `default`, then the instances will be created in EC2 VPC and the parameter `SECURITY_GROUP` will be ignored. For GCE, this parameter is not used. - `MACHINE_SPEC`: Specifications of the instance to be created. You can specify attributes such as the operating system, Amazon Machine Image (AMI), hardware properties, EC2 instance type and EC2 region. Please see the [Setting Up For EC2 section](#setting-up-for-ec2) for an example `MACHINE-SPEC` value and please refer to the `TemplateBuilderSpec` class of the `org.jclouds.compute.domain` package at jclouds&amp;reg; JavaDoc for a full list of machine specifications. Please refer to [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) for more information, such as for [Amazon EC2 instance types](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/). - `HAZELCAST_VERSION_SPEC`: The workers can be configured to use a specific version of Hazelcast. By this way, you do not need to depend on the Hazelcast version provided by the simulator. You can configure the Hazelcast version in one of the following ways: 	- `outofthebox`: This is the default value provided by the Simulator itself. 	- `maven=&lt;version&gt;`: Used to give a specific version from the maven repository (for examples, `maven=3.2`, `maven=3.3-SNAPSHOT`). Local Hazelcast artifacts will be preferred, so you can checkout, for example, an experimental branch and build the artifacts locally. This will all be done on the local machine, not on the agent machine. 	- `bringmyown`: Used to specify your own dependencies. For more information on the values, please see the `--workerClassPath` setting of the Controller. 	- `git=&lt;version&gt;`: If you want the Simulator to use a specific version of Hazelcast from GIT, you can use this parameter (for example, `git=f0288f713` to build a specific revision, or `git=v3.2.3` to build a version from a GIT tag, or `git=&lt;your repository&gt;/&lt;your branch&gt;` to build a version from a branch in a specific repository). Use the parameter `GIT_CUSTOM_REPOSITORIES` to specify custom repositories, explained below. The main Hazelcast repository is always named  as `origin`. - `GIT_BUILD_DIR`: When you set the parameter `HAZELCAST_VERSION_SPEC` to `git=&lt;version&gt;`, the Hazelcast sources will be downloaded to this directory. Its default value is `$HOME/.hazelcast-build/` - `GIT_CUSTOM_REPOSITORIES`: Comma separated list of additional GIT repositories to be fetched. Use this parameter when you set the parameter `HAZELCAST_VERSION_SPEC` to `git=&lt;version&gt;` and specify additional repositories. Hazelcast Simulator will always fetch the repository at [https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast). This parameter specifies additional repositories. You can use both remote and local repositories. Remote repositories must be accessible for anonymous and local repositories must be accessible for the current user. Its default value is empty. Only the main Hazelcast repository is used by default. - `MVN_EXECUTABLE`: This parameter specifies the path to a local Maven installation when you set the parameter `HAZELCAST_VERSION_SPEC` to `git=&lt;version&gt;`. Its default value is `/usr/bin/mvn`. - `JDK_FLAVOR`: Available flavors are `oracle`, `openjdk`, `ibm` and `outofthebox`. `outofthebox` is the one provided by the image so no software is installed by the Simulator. If you select a flavor different than `outofthebox`, the currect behavior is that only 64-bit JVMs are going to be installed. Therefore, make sure that your operating system is 64-bit.  - `JDK_64_BITS`: Specifies whether a 64-bit JVM should be installed or not. For now, only `true` is allowed. - `JDK_VERSION`: The version of Java to be installed. Oracle and IBM support 6, 7, and 8. OpenJDK supports 6 and 7. - `PROFILER`: The worker can be configured with a profiler. Available options are `none`, `yourkit`, `hprof`, `perf`, `vtune` and `flightrecorder`.

    title: "Performance and Benchmarking",
    body: "## Performance and Benchmarking   Hazelcast Simulator can use probes to record throughput and latency while running a test. Hazelcast Simulator can inject a probe into a test, and then it is the responsibility of the test to notify the probe about the start/end of each action.  There are two classes of probes:  - `SimpleProbe`: Counts the number of events. It does not have a notion of start/end. - `IntervalProbe`: Differentiates between start/end of an action. Used to measure latency.  How to use probes is explained below.  1. Define a probe as a test property. Hazelcast Simulator will inject the appropriate probe implementation.     ``` public class IntIntMapTest {     private static final ILogger log = Logger.getLogger(IntIntMapTest.class);     private enum Operation {         PUT,         GET     }     [...]     // Probes will be injected by Hazelcast Simulator     public IntervalProbe intervalProbe;     public IntervalProbe anotherIntervalProbe;     public SimpleProbe simpleProbe;    ```  2. Use the probe in your test code.     ```     getLatency.started();     map.get(key);     getLatency.done();    ```  3. Configure the probe in your `test.properties` file.     ``` probe-intervalProbe=throughput probe-simpleProbe=throughput    ```  The configuration format is `probe-&lt;nameOfField&gt;=&lt;type&gt;`, where `nameOfField` is the name you choose for the probe, and `type` is the type of probe. Please keep in mind that this format is likely to change in future versions of Hazelcast Simulator.  A probe of class `IntervalProbe` can have the following types.  - `latency`: Measures the latency distribution. - `maxLatency`: Records the highest latency. Unlike the previous probe, it records only the single highest latency measured, not a full distribution. - `hdr`: Same as latency, but it uses HdrHistogram under the hood. This will replace the latency probe in future versions of Simulator. - `disabled`: Dummy probe. It does not record anything.  A probe of class `SimpleProbe` can have the following implementations.  - `throughput`: Measures throughput. - `disabled`: Dummy probe. It does not record anything.   It is important to understand that the class of a probe does not mandate what the probe is actually measuring. Therefore, the tests just know a class of probe, but they do not know if the probe generates, for example, a full latency histogram or just a maximum recorded latency. This detail must be implemented from a point of view of a test.   "

Every cluster would be operating at native speed in their own LAN (Local Area Network), but you also want some or all recordsets in these clusters to be replicated to each other: updates in the Tokyo cluster should also replicate to London and New York, in the meantime updates in the New York cluster are synchronized to the Tokyo and London clusters.

    title: "Configuring WAN Replication",
    body: "### Configuring WAN Replication  The current WAN Replication implementation supports two different operation modes.  - **Active-Passive:** This mode is mostly used for failover scenarios where you want to replicate an active cluster to one   or more passive clusters, for the purpose of maintaining a backup.  - **Active-Active:** Every cluster is equal, each cluster replicate to all other clusters. This is normally used to connect   different clients to different clusters for the sake of the shortest path between client and server.  Let's see how we can configure WAN Replication from the New York cluster to target the London and Tokyo clusters:  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;wan-replication name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;&gt;     &lt;target-cluster group-name=\&quot;tokyo\&quot; group-password=\&quot;tokyo-pass\&quot;&gt;       &lt;replication-impl&gt;com.hazelcast.wan.impl.WanNoDelayReplication&lt;/replication-impl&gt;       &lt;end-points&gt;         &lt;address&gt;10.2.1.1:5701&lt;/address&gt;         &lt;address&gt;10.2.1.2:5701&lt;/address&gt;       &lt;/end-points&gt;     &lt;/target-cluster&gt;     &lt;target-cluster group-name=\&quot;london\&quot; group-password=\&quot;london-pass\&quot;&gt;       &lt;replication-impl&gt;com.hazelcast.wan.impl.WanNoDelayReplication&lt;/replication-impl&gt;       &lt;end-points&gt;         &lt;address&gt;10.3.5.1:5701&lt;/address&gt;         &lt;address&gt;10.3.5.2:5701&lt;/address&gt;       &lt;/end-points&gt;     &lt;/target-cluster&gt;   &lt;/wan-replication&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  Using this configuration, the cluster running in New York is replicating to Tokyo and London. The Tokyo and London clusters should have a similar configurations if you want to run in Active-Active mode.  If the New York and London cluster configurations contain the `wan-replication` element and the Tokyo cluster does not, it means New York and London are active endpoints and Tokyo is a passive endpoint.  When using Active-Active Replication, multiple clusters can simultaneously update the same entry in a distributed data structure. You can configure a merge-policy to resolve these potential conflicts.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;wan-replication name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;&gt;     &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy&lt;/merge-policy&gt;     ...   &lt;/wan-replication&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  Hazelcast can configure WAN replication on a per Map basis. Imagine you have different distributed maps, however only one map should be replicated to a target cluster. To achieve this, configure map to be replicated by adding the `wan-replication-ref` element in the map configuration as shown below.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;wan-replication name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;&gt;     ...   &lt;/wan-replication&gt;   &lt;map name=\&quot;my-shared-map\&quot;&gt;     &lt;wan-replication-ref name=\&quot;my-wan-cluster\&quot;&gt;     &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy&lt;/merge-policy&gt;       ...     &lt;/wan-replication-ref&gt;   &lt;/map&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  You see that we have `my-shared-map` configured to replicate itself to the cluster targets defined in the earlier `wan-replication` element.  You will also have to define a `merge policy` for merging replica entries and resolving conflicts during the merge as mentioned before.  "

    body: "## Configuration Overview  Hazelcast can be configured declaratively (XML) or programmatically (API) or even by a mix of both.  **1- Declarative Configuration**  If you are creating new Hazelcast instance by passing the `null` parameter to `Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(null)` or just using an empty factory method (`Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance()`), Hazelcast will look in two places for the configuration file.  - **System property:** Hazelcast will first check if \&quot;`hazelcast.config`\&quot; system property is set to a file path. Example: `-Dhazelcast.config=C:/myhazelcast.xml`. - **Classpath:** If config file is not set as a system property, Hazelcast will check classpath for `hazelcast.xml` file.  If Hazelcast does not find any configuration file, it will start with the default configuration (`hazelcast-default.xml`) located in `hazelcast.jar`. (Before configuring Hazelcast, please try to work with the default configuration to see if it works for you. Default should be just fine for most users. If not, then consider custom configuration for your environment.)  If you want to specify your own configuration file to create `Config`, Hazelcast supports several ways including filesystem, classpath, InputStream, URL, etc.:  - `Config cfg = new XmlConfigBuilder(xmlFileName).build();` - `Config cfg = new XmlConfigBuilder(inputStream).build();` - `Config cfg = new ClasspathXmlConfig(xmlFileName);` - `Config cfg = new FileSystemXmlConfig(configFilename);` - `Config cfg = new UrlXmlConfig(url);` - `Config cfg = new InMemoryXmlConfig(xml);`    **2- Programmatic Configuration**  To configure Hazelcast programmatically, just instantiate a `Config` object and set/change its properties/attributes to your needs. Below is a code sample in which some network, map, map store, and near cache attributes are configured for a Hazelcast instance.  ```java Config config = new Config(); config.getNetworkConfig().setPort( 5900 ); config.getNetworkConfig().setPortAutoIncrement( false );          NetworkConfig network = config.getNetworkConfig(); JoinConfig join = network.getJoin(); join.getMulticastConfig().setEnabled( false ); join.getTcpIpConfig().addMember( \&quot;10.45.67.32\&quot; ).addMember( \&quot;10.45.67.100\&quot; )             .setRequiredMember( \&quot;192.168.10.100\&quot; ).setEnabled( true ); network.getInterfaces().setEnabled( true ).addInterface( \&quot;10.45.67.*\&quot; );          MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig(); mapConfig.setName( \&quot;testMap\&quot; ); mapConfig.setBackupCount( 2 ); mapConfig.getMaxSizeConfig().setSize( 10000 ); mapConfig.setTimeToLiveSeconds( 300 );          MapStoreConfig mapStoreConfig = new MapStoreConfig(); mapStoreConfig.setClassName( \&quot;com.hazelcast.examples.DummyStore\&quot; )     .setEnabled( true ); mapConfig.setMapStoreConfig( mapStoreConfig );  NearCacheConfig nearCacheConfig = new NearCacheConfig(); nearCacheConfig.setMaxSize( 1000 ).setMaxIdleSeconds( 120 )     .setTimeToLiveSeconds( 300 ); mapConfig.setNearCacheConfig( nearCacheConfig );  config.addMapConfig( mapConfig ); ```  After creating a `Config` object, you can use it to create a new Hazelcast instance.  - `HazelcastInstance hazelcast = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config );` - To create a named `HazelcastInstance` you should set `instanceName` of `Config` object.   ```java Config config = new Config(); config.setInstanceName( \&quot;my-instance\&quot; ); Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance( config ); ```  - To retrieve an existing `HazelcastInstance` using its name, use;          `Hazelcast.getHazelcastInstanceByName( \&quot;my-instance\&quot; );`  - To retrieve all existing `HazelcastInstance`s, use;      `Hazelcast.getAllHazelcastInstances();`   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *Hazelcast performs the schema validation through the `hazelcast-config-&lt;version&gt;.xsd` file.

These two configurations are shown below.  `development-group-config.xml`:  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;group&gt;       &lt;name&gt;dev&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;password&gt;dev-pass&lt;/password&gt;   &lt;/group&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ``` &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  `development-network-config.xml`:  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;network&gt;     &lt;port auto-increment=\&quot;true\&quot; port-count=\&quot;100\&quot;&gt;5701&lt;/port&gt;     &lt;join&gt;         &lt;multicast enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;             &lt;multicast-group&gt;224.2.2.3&lt;/multicast-group&gt;             &lt;multicast-port&gt;54327&lt;/multicast-port&gt;         &lt;/multicast&gt;     &lt;/join&gt;   &lt;/network&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  To get your example Hazelcast declarative configuration out of the above two, use the `&lt;import/&gt;` element as shown below.   ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;import resource=\&quot;development-group-config.xml\&quot;/&gt;   &lt;import resource=\&quot;development-network-config.xml\&quot;/&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  This feature also applies to the declarative configuration of Hazelcast Client. Please see the following examples.   `client-group-config.xml`:  ```xml &lt;hazelcast-client&gt;   &lt;group&gt;       &lt;name&gt;dev&lt;/name&gt;       &lt;password&gt;dev-pass&lt;/password&gt;   &lt;/group&gt; &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt; ``` &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  `client-network-config.xml`:  ```xml &lt;hazelcast-client&gt;     &lt;network&gt;         &lt;cluster-members&gt;             &lt;address&gt;127.0.0.1:7000&lt;/address&gt;         &lt;/cluster-members&gt;     &lt;/network&gt; &lt;/hazelcast-client&gt; ```  To get a Hazelcast Client declarative configuration from the above two examples, use the `&lt;import/&gt;` element as shown below.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast-client&gt;   &lt;import resource=\&quot;client-group-config.xml\&quot;/&gt;   &lt;import resource=\&quot;client-network-config.xml\&quot;/&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *You can only use `&lt;import/&gt;` element on top level of the XML hierarchy.* &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  - XML resources can be loaded from classpath and filesystem. Please see the following example.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;import resource=\&quot;file:///etc/hazelcast/development-group-config.xml\&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- loaded from filesystem --&gt;   &lt;import resource=\&quot;classpath:development-network-config.xml\&quot;/&gt;  &lt;!-- loaded from classpath --&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  - You can use property placeholders in the `&lt;import/&gt;` elements. Please see the following example.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   &lt;import resource=\&quot;${environment}-group-config.xml\&quot;/&gt;   &lt;import resource=\&quot;${environment}-network-config.xml\&quot;/&gt; &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```     "

We assume that the reader is familiar with these tags' programmatic equivalents, since declarative and programmatic approaches have the similar tag/method names. For example, the `port-count` tag in declarative configuration is equivalent to `setPortCount` in programmatic configuration.*   All network related configuration is performed via the `network` element in the Hazelcast XML configuration file or the class `NetworkConfig` when using programmatic configuration.

Meaning that, if you set the value of port as 5701, as members are joining to the cluster, Hazelcast tries to find ports between 5701 and 5801. You can choose to change the port count in the cases like having large instances on a single machine or willing to have only a few ports to be assigned. The parameter `port-count` is used for this purpose, whose default value is 100.    - `auto-increment`: According to the above example, Hazelcast will try to find free ports between 5701 and 5801. Normally, you will not need to change this value, but it will come very handy when needed. You may also want to choose to use only one port. In that case, you can disable the auto-increment feature of `port` by setting `auto-increment` to `false`.   The parameter `port-count` is ignored when the above configuration is made.  "

[Interfaces](#interfaces) configuration does not have this limitation, you can configure wildcard IPv6 interfaces in the same way as IPv4 interfaces.  ```xml &lt;hazelcast&gt;   ...   &lt;network&gt;     &lt;port auto-increment=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;5701&lt;/port&gt;     &lt;join&gt;       &lt;multicast enabled=\&quot;false\&quot;&gt;         &lt;multicast-group&gt;FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1&lt;/multicast-group&gt;         &lt;multicast-port&gt;54327&lt;/multicast-port&gt;       &lt;/multicast&gt;       &lt;tcp-ip enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;         &lt;member&gt;[fe80::223:6cff:fe93:7c7e]:5701&lt;/member&gt;         &lt;interface&gt;192.168.1.0-7&lt;/interface&gt;         &lt;interface&gt;192.168.1.*&lt;/interface&gt;         &lt;interface&gt;fe80:0:0:0:45c5:47ee:fe15:493a&lt;/interface&gt;       &lt;/tcp-ip&gt;     &lt;/join&gt;     &lt;interfaces enabled=\&quot;true\&quot;&gt;       &lt;interface&gt;10.3.16.*&lt;/interface&gt;       &lt;interface&gt;10.3.10.4-18&lt;/interface&gt;       &lt;interface&gt;fe80:0:0:0:45c5:47ee:fe15:*&lt;/interface&gt;       &lt;interface&gt;fe80::223:6cff:fe93:0-5555&lt;/interface&gt;     &lt;/interfaces&gt;     ...   &lt;/network&gt;   ... &lt;/hazelcast&gt; ```  JVM has two system properties for setting the preferred protocol stack (IPv4 or IPv6) as well as the preferred address family types (inet4 or inet6). On a dual stack machine, IPv6 stack is preferred by default, you can change this through the `java.net.preferIPv4Stack=&lt;true|false&gt;` system property. When querying name services, JVM prefers IPv4 addresses over IPv6 addresses and will return an IPv4 address if possible. You can change this through `java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=&lt;true|false&gt;` system property.  Also see additional [details on IPv6 support in Java](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/net/ipv6_guide/query.html#details).  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *IPv6 support has been switched off by default, since some platforms have issues using the IPv6 stack. Some other platforms such as Amazon AWS have no support at all. To enable IPv6 support, just set configuration property `hazelcast.prefer.ipv4.stack` to *false*. Please refer to the [System Properties section](#system-properties) for details.*     "

It has two values: BINARY and OBJECT. BINARY is the default option, storing the data in serialized binary format. If set to OBJECT, data will be stored in deserialized form. - `backup-count`: Defines the count of synchronous backups. If it is set as 1, for example, backup of a partition will be placed on 1 other node. If it is 2, it will be placed on 2 other nodes. - `async-backup-count`: The number of synchronous backups. Count behavior is the same as that of `backup-count` element. - `read-backup-data`: When set to `true`, enables reading of local backup entries. - `time-to-live-seconds`: Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay in the map. - `max-idle-seconds`: Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay idle in the map. - `eviction-policy`: Policy for evicting entries. It has three values: NONE, LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used). If set to NONE, no items will be evicted. - `max-size`: Maximum size of the map (i.e. maximum entry count of the map). When the maximum size is reached, the map is evicted based on the eviction policy defined. It has four attributes: `PER_NODE` (Maximum number of map entries in each JVM), `PER_PARTITION` (Maximum number of map entries within each partition), `USED_HEAP_SIZE` (Maximum used heap size in megabytes for each JVM) and `USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE` (Maximum used heap size percentage for each JVM).  - `eviction-percentage`: When the map reaches `max-size`, this specified percentage of the map will be evicted. - `merge-policy`: Policy for merging maps after a split-brain syndrome was detected and the different network partitions need to be merged. The available merge policy classes are explained below. 	- `HigherHitsMapMergePolicy` causes the merging entry to be merged from the source map to the destination map if the source entry has more hits than the destination one. 	- `LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy` causes the merging entry to be merged from the source map to the destination map if the source entry has updated more recently than the destination entry. This policy can only be used if the machine clocks are in sync. 	- `PassThroughMergePolicy` causes the merging entry to be merged from source to destination map unless merging entry is null. 	- `PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy` causes the merging entry to be merged from source to destination map if it does not exist in the destination map. - `statistics-enabled`: You can retrieve statistics information like owned entry count, backup entry count, last update time, and locked entry count by setting `statistics-enabled` to `true`. The method for retrieving the statistics is `getLocalMapStats()`. - `wan-replication-ref`: Hazelcast can replicate some or all of the cluster data. For example, suppose you can have 5 different maps but you want only one of these maps to replicate across clusters. To achieve this, you mark the maps to be replicated by adding this element in the map configuration. - `optimize-queries`: This element is used to increase the speed of query processes in the map. It only works when `in-memory-format` is set as `BINARY` and performs a pre-caching on the entries queried.  "

Otherwise it is write-behind so updates will be stored after write-delay-seconds value by calling Hazelcast.storeAll(map). Default value is 0. - `write-batch-size`: Used to create batch chunks when writing map store. In default mode, all map entries will be tried to be written in one go. To create batch chunks, the minimum meaningful value for write-batch-size is 2. For values smaller than 2, it works as in default mode. - `write-coalescing`: In write-behind mode, by default Hazelcast coalesces updates on a specific key, i.e. applies only the last update on it.

Very low numbers can prevent successful execution since the job might not be correctly scheduled or intermediate chunks are lost. - `retry-count`: Currently not used but reserved for later use where the framework will automatically try to restart / retry operations from an available save point. - `chunk-size`: Defines the number of emitted values before a chunk is sent to the reducers. If your emitted values are big or you want to better balance your work, you might want to change this to a lower or higher value. A value of 0 means immediate transmission, but remember that low values mean higher traffic costs. A very high value might cause an OutOfMemoryError if the emitted values do not fit into heap memory before being sent to reducers. To prevent this, you might want to use a combiner to pre-reduce values on mapping nodes. - `communicate-stats`: Defines if statistics (for example, about processed entries) are transmitted to the job emitter. This might be used to show some kind of progress to a user inside of an UI system, but it produces additional traffic. If not needed, you might want to deactivate this. - `topology-changed-strategy`: Defines how the MapReduce framework will react on topology changes while executing a job.

    title: "Partition Group Configuration",
    body: "## Partition Group Configuration  Hazelcast distributes key objects into partitions using a consistent hashing algorithm. Those partitions are assigned to nodes. An entry is stored in the node that owns the partition to which the entry's key is assigned. The total partition count is 271 by default; you can change it with the configuration property `hazelcast.map.partition.count`. Please see the [System Properties section](#system-properties).  Along with those partitions, there are also copies of the partitions as backups. Backup partitions can have multiple copies due to the backup count defined in configuration, such as first backup partition, second backup partition, etc. A node cannot hold more than one copy of a partition (ownership or backup). By default, Hazelcast distributes partitions and their backup copies randomly and equally among cluster nodes, assuming all nodes in the cluster are identical.  But what if some nodes share the same JVM or physical machine or chassis and you want backups of these nodes to be assigned to nodes in another machine or chassis? What if processing or memory capacities of some nodes are different and you do not want an equal number of partitions to be assigned to all nodes?  You can group nodes in the same JVM (or physical machine) or nodes located in the same chassis. Or you can group nodes to create identical capacity. We call these groups **partition groups**. Partitions are assigned to those partition groups instead of to single nodes. Backups of these partitions are located in another partition group.  When you enable partition grouping, Hazelcast presents three choices for you to configure partition groups.  - You can group nodes automatically using the IP addresses of nodes, so nodes sharing the same network interface will be grouped together. All members on the same host (IP address or domain name) will be a single partition group. This helps to avoid data loss when a physical server crashes, because multiple replicas of the same partition are not stored on the same host. But if there are multiple network interfaces or domain names per physical machine, that will make this assumption invalid.  ```xml &lt;partition-group enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; group-type=\&quot;HOST_AWARE\&quot; /&gt; ```  ```java Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true )     .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.HOST_AWARE ); ```  - You can do custom grouping using Hazelcast's interface matching configuration. This way, you can add different and multiple interfaces to a group. You can also use wildcards in the interface addresses. For example, the users can create rack aware or data warehouse partition groups using custom partition grouping.  ```xml &lt;partition-group enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; group-type=\&quot;CUSTOM\&quot;&gt; &lt;member-group&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.0.*&lt;/interface&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.3.*&lt;/interface&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.5.*&lt;/interface&gt; &lt;/member-group&gt; &lt;member-group&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.10.10-100&lt;/interface&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.1.*&lt;/interface&gt;   &lt;interface&gt;10.10.2.*&lt;/interface&gt; &lt;/member-group &lt;/partition-group&gt; ```  ```java Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true )     .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.CUSTOM );  MemberGroupConfig memberGroupConfig = new MemberGroupConfig(); memberGroupConfig.addInterface( \&quot;10.10.0.*\&quot; ) .addInterface( \&quot;10.10.3.*\&quot; ).addInterface(\&quot;10.10.5.*\&quot; );  MemberGroupConfig memberGroupConfig2 = new MemberGroupConfig(); memberGroupConfig2.addInterface( \&quot;10.10.10.10-100\&quot; ) .addInterface( \&quot;10.10.1.*\&quot;).addInterface( \&quot;10.10.2.*\&quot; );  partitionGroupConfig.addMemberGroupConfig( memberGroupConfig ); partitionGroupConfig.addMemberGroupConfig( memberGroupConfig2 ); ```  - You can give every member its own group. Each member is a group of its own and primary and backup partitions are distributed randomly (not on the same physical member). This gives the least amount of protection and is the default configuration for a Hazelcast cluster.  ```xml &lt;partition-group enabled=\&quot;true\&quot; group-type=\&quot;PER_MEMBER\&quot; /&gt; ```  ```java Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true )     .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.PER_MEMBER ); ```       "

To use it, implement the `com.hazelcast.logging.LoggerFactory` and `com.hazelcast.logging.ILogger` interfaces and set the system property `hazelcast.logging.class` as your custom `LoggerFactory` class name.  ```plain -Dhazelcast.logging.class=foo.bar.MyLoggingFactory ```  You can also listen to logging events generated by Hazelcast runtime by registering `LogListener`s to `LoggingService`.  ```java LogListener listener = new LogListener() {   public void log( LogEvent logEvent ) {     // do something   } } HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); LoggingService loggingService = instance.getLoggingService(); loggingService.addLogListener( Level.INFO, listener ); ``` Through the `LoggingService`, you can get the currently used ILogger implementation and log your own messages too.  ![image](images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *If you are not using command line for configuring logging, you should be careful about Hazelcast classes.

As a result, you end up having two separate clusters: 4-node cluster and 6-node cluster. Members in each sub-cluster think that the other nodes are dead even though they are not. This situation is called Network Partitioning (a.k.a. *Split-Brain Syndrome*).  However, these two clusters have a combination of the 271 (using default) primary and backup partitions. It’s very likely that not all of the 271 partitions, including both primaries and backups, exist in both mini-clusters. Therefore, from each mini-cluster’s perspective, data has been lost as some partitions no longer exist (they exist on the other segment).  "

This overwrite scenario represents a potential data loss, and thus the database design should consider an insert and aggregate on read or version strategy rather than update records in place.  If the network to the database is not available, then based on the configured or coded consistency level or transaction, entry updates are held in cache or updates are rejected (fully synchronous and consistent).

If they do, how are the data conflicts resolved, because you might end up having two different values for the same key in the same map?  When the network is restored, all 271 partitions should exist in both mini-clusters and they should all undergo the merge. Once all primaries are merged, all backups are rewritten so their versions are correct. You may want to write a merge policy using the `MapMergePolicy` interface that rebuilds the entry from the database rather than from memory.  The only metadata available for merge decisions are from the `EntryView` interface that includes object size (cost), hits count, last updated/stored dates, and a version number that starts at zero and is incremented for each entry update. You could also create your own versioning scheme or capture a time series of deltas to reconstruct an entry.  "

    body: "## How Hazelcast Split Brain Merge Happens  Here is, step by step, how Hazelcast split brain merge happens:  1. The oldest member of the cluster checks if there is another cluster with the same *group-name* and *group-password* in the network. 2. If the oldest member finds such a cluster, then it figures out which cluster should merge to the other. 3. Each member of the merging cluster will do the following.  - Pause. - Take locally owned map entries. - Close all of its network connections (detach from its cluster). - Join to the new cluster. - Send merge request for each of its locally owned map entry. - Resume. 	 Each member of the merging cluster rejoins the new cluster and sends a merge request for each of its locally owned map entries. Two important points:  -	The smaller cluster will merge into the bigger one. If they have equal number of members then a hashing algorithm determines the merging cluster. -	Each cluster may have different versions of the same key in the same map. The destination cluster will decide how to handle merging entry based on the `MergePolicy` set for that map. There are built-in merge policies such as `PassThroughMergePolicy`, `PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy`, `HigherHitsMapMergePolicy` and `LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy`. You can develop your own merge policy by implementing `com.hazelcast.map.merge.MapMergePolicy`. You should set the full class name of your implementation to the `merge-policy` configuration.   ```java public interface MergePolicy {   /**   * Returns the value of the entry after the merge   * of entries with the same key. Returning value can be   * You should consider the case where existingEntry is null.   *   * @param mapName       name of the map   * @param mergingEntry  entry merging into the destination cluster   * @param existingEntry existing entry in the destination cluster   * @return final value of the entry.

When you store a key and value in a distributed Map, Hazelcast serializes the key and value, and stores the byte array version of them in local ConcurrentHashMaps. These ConcurrentHashMaps use `equals` and `hashCode` methods of byte array version of your key. It does not take into account the actual `equals` and `hashCode` implementations of your objects. So it is important that you choose your keys in a proper way.   Implementing `equals` and `hashCode` is not enough, it is also important that the object is always serialized into the same byte array. All primitive types like String, Long, Integer, etc. are good candidates for keys to be used in Hazelcast. An unsorted Set is an example of a very bad candidate because Java Serialization may serialize the same unsorted set in two different byte arrays.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

    title: "How do I test my Hazelcast cluster?",
    body: "## How do I test my Hazelcast cluster?  Hazelcast allows you to create more than one instance on the same JVM. Each member is called `HazelcastInstance` and each will have its own configuration, socket and threads, so you can treat them as totally separate instances.   This enables you to write and to run cluster unit tests on a single JVM. Because you can use this feature for creating separate members different applications running on the same JVM (imagine running multiple web applications on the same JVM), you can also use this feature for testing your Hazelcast cluster.  Let's say you want to test if two members have the same size of a map.  ```java @Test public void testTwoMemberMapSizes() {   // start the first member   HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   // get the map and put 1000 entries   Map map1 = h1.getMap( \&quot;testmap\&quot; );   for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++ ) {     map1.put( i, \&quot;value\&quot; + i );   }   // check the map size   assertEquals( 1000, map1.size() );   // start the second member   HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   // get the same map from the second member   Map map2 = h2.getMap( \&quot;testmap\&quot; );   // check the size of map2   assertEquals( 1000, map2.size() );   // check the size of map1 again   assertEquals( 1000, map1.size() ); } ```  In the test above, everything happens in the same thread. When developing a multi-threaded test, you need to carefully handle coordination of the thread executions. it is highly recommended that you use `CountDownLatch` for thread coordination (you can certainly use other ways). Here is an example where we need to listen for messages and make sure that we got these messages.  ```java @Test public void testTopic() {   // start two member cluster   HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();   String topicName = \&quot;TestMessages\&quot;;   // get a topic from the first member and add a messageListener   ITopic&lt;String&gt; topic1 = h1.getTopic( topicName );   final CountDownLatch latch1 = new CountDownLatch( 1 );   topic1.addMessageListener( new MessageListener() {     public void onMessage( Object msg ) {       assertEquals( \&quot;Test1\&quot;, msg );       latch1.countDown();     }   });   // get a topic from the second member and add a messageListener   ITopic&lt;String&gt; topic2 = h2.getTopic(topicName);   final CountDownLatch latch2 = new CountDownLatch( 2 );   topic2.addMessageListener( new MessageListener() {     public void onMessage( Object msg ) {       assertEquals( \&quot;Test1\&quot;, msg );       latch2.countDown();     }   } );   // publish the first message, both should receive this   topic1.publish( \&quot;Test1\&quot; );   // shutdown the first member   h1.shutdown();   // publish the second message, second member's topic should receive this   topic2.publish( \&quot;Test1\&quot; );   try {     // assert that the first member's topic got the message     assertTrue( latch1.await( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) );     // assert that the second members' topic got two messages     assertTrue( latch2.await( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) );   } catch ( InterruptedException ignored ) {   } } ``` You can start Hazelcast members with different configurations.

The environment should be LAN with a high stability and the network speed should be 10 Gbps or higher. If the number of nodes is high, the client type should be selected as Dummy, not Smart Client. In the case of Smart Clients, since each client will open a connection to the nodes, these nodes should be powerful enough (for example, more cores) to handle hundreds or thousands of connections and client requests. Also, you should consider using near caches in clients to lower the network traffic. And you should use the Hazelcast releases with the NIO implementation (which starts with Hazelcast 3.2).  Also, you should configure the clients attentively. Please refer to the [Java Client section](#hazelcast-java-client) section for configuration notes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

Your applications are hosted on the clients, and the clients communicate with the nodes in the cluster to reach data.   Client-server topology fits better if there are multiple applications sharing the same data or if application deployment is significantly greater than the cluster size (for example, 500 application servers vs. 10 node cluster).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

If you encounter an error of `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread`, it may be caused by exceeding the available file descriptors on your operating system, especially if it is Linux. This exception is usually thrown on a running node, after a period of time when the thread count exhausts the file descriptor availability.  The JVM on Linux consumes a file descriptor for each thread created.  The default number of file descriptors available in Linux is usually 1024. If you have many JVMs running on a single machine, it is possible to exceed this default number.  You can view the limit using the following command.  `# ulimit -a`  At the operating system level, Linux users can control the amount of resources (and in particular, file descriptors) used via one of the following options.  1 - Editing the `limits.conf` file:  `# vi /etc/security/limits.conf`   ``` testuser soft nofile 4096&lt;br&gt; testuser hard nofile 10240&lt;br&gt; ```  2 - Or using the `ulimit` command:  `# ulimit -Hn`  ``` 10240 ```  The default number of process per users is 1024. Adding the following to your `$HOME/.profile` could solve the issue:  `# ulimit -u 4096`  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  "

    body: "# Glossary  Term|Definition :-|:- **2-phase Commit**|2-phase commit protocol is an atomic commitment protocol for distributed systems. It consists of two phases: commit-request and commit. In commit-request phase, transaction manager coordinates all of the transaction resources to commit or abort. In commit-phase, transaction manager decides to finalize operation by committing or aborting according to the votes of the each transaction resource. **ACID**|A set of properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guaranteeing that transactions are processed reliably. Atomicity requires that each transaction be all or nothing (i.e. if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction will fail). Consistency ensures that only valid data following all rules and constraints is written. Isolation ensures that transactions are securely and independently processed at the same time without interference (and without transaction ordering). Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, no matter if there is a power loss, crash, or error. **Cache**|A high-speed access area that can be either a reserved section of main memory or storage device.  **Garbage Collection**|Garbage collection is the recovery of storage that is being used by an application when that application no longer needs the storage. This frees the storage for use by other applications (or processes within an application). It also ensures that an application using increasing amounts of storage does not reach its quota. Programming languages that use garbage collection are often interpreted within virtual machines like the JVM. The environment that runs the code is also responsible for garbage collection. **Hazelcast Cluster**|It is a virtual environment formed by Hazelcast nodes communicating with each other. **Hazelcast Partitions**|Memory segments containing the data. Hazelcast is built-on the partition concept, it uses partitions to store and process data. Each partition can have hundreds or thousands of data entries depending on your memory capacity. You can think of a partition as a block of data. In general and optimally, a partition should have a maximum size of 50-100 Megabytes. **IMDG**|An in-memory data grid (IMDG) is a data structure that resides entirely in memory, and is distributed among many nodes in a single location or across multiple locations. IMDGs can support thousands of in-memory data updates per second, and they can be clustered and scaled in ways that support large quantities of data. **Invalidation**|The process of marking an object as being invalid across the distributed cache. **Java heap**|Java heap is the space that Java can reserve and use in memory for dynamic memory allocation. All runtime objects created by a Java application are stored in heap. By default, the heap size is 128 MB, but this limit is reached easily for business applications. Once the heap is full, new objects cannot be created and the Java application shows errors. **LRU, LFU**|LRU and LFU are two of eviction algorithms. LRU is the abbreviation for Least Recently Used. It refers to entries eligible for eviction due to lack of interest by applications. LFU is the abbreviation for Least Frequently Used. It refers to the entries eligible for eviction due to having the lowest usage frequency. +**Member**|A Hazelcast instance. Depending on your Hazelcast usage, it can refer to a server or a Java virtual machine (JVM). Members are also referred as `nodes`.  **Multicast**|It is a type of communication where data is addressed to a group of destination nodes simultaneously. **Near Cache**|It is a caching model. When it is enabled, an object retrieved from a remote node is put into the local cache and the future requests made to this object will be handled by this local node. For example, if you have a map with data that is mostly read, then using near cache is a good idea. **NoSQL**|\&quot;Not Only SQL\&quot;. It is a database model that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is tailored in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. It is a type of database which does not adhering to the traditional relational database management system (RDMS) structure. It is not built on tables and does not employ SQL to manipulate data. It also may not provide full ACID guarantees, but still has a distributed and fault tolerant architecture. **Race Condition**|This condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. **RSA**|An algorithm developed by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman to generate, encrypt and decrypt keys for secure data transmissions.  **Serialization**|Process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization. **Split Brain**|Split brain syndrome, in a clustering context, is a state in which a cluster of nodes gets divided (or partitioned) into smaller clusters of nodes, each of which believes it is the only active cluster. **Transaction**|Means a sequence of information exchange and related work (such as data store updating) that is treated as a unit for the purposes of satisfying a request and for ensuring data store integrity.
