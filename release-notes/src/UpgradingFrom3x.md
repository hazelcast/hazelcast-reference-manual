# Upgrading from 3.x


- **Introducing the `spring-aware` element:**
Before the release 3.5, Hazelcast uses `SpringManagedContext` to scan `SpringAware` annotations by default. This may cause some performance overhead for the users who do not use `SpringAware`.
This behavior has been changed with the release of Hazelcast 3.5. `SpringAware` annotations are disabled by default. By introducing the `spring-aware` element, now it is possible to enable it by adding the `<hz:spring-aware />` tag to the configuration. Please see the [Spring Integration section](#spring-integration).
