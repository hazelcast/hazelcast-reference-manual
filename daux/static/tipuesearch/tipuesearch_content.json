The functionality of these methods can be reached from the HazelcastInstance interface. You should replace the following: Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; customers = Hazelcast.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); with HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); \/\/ or if you already started an instance named &quot;instance1&quot; \/\/ HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.getHazelcastInstanceByName( &quot;instance1&quot; ); Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); Renaming &quot;instance&quot; to &quot;distributed object&quot;: Before 3.0 there was confusion about the term &quot;instance&quot;: it was used for both the cluster members and the distributed objects (map, queue, topic, etc. instances). Starting with 3.0, the term instance will be only used for Hazelcast instances, namely cluster members. We will use the term &quot;distributed object&quot; for map, queue, etc. instances. You should replace the related methods with the new renamed ones. 3.0 clients are smart clients in that they know in which cluster member the data is located, so you can replace your lite members with native clients. public static void main( String[] args ) throws InterruptedException { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;test&quot; ); Collection&lt;Instance&gt; instances = hazelcastInstance.getInstances(); for ( Instance instance : instances ) { if ( instance.getInstanceType() == Instance.InstanceType.MAP ) { System.out.println( &quot;There is a map with name: &quot; + instance.getId() ); } } } with public static void main( String[] args ) throws InterruptedException { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IMap map = hz.getMap( &quot;test&quot; ); Collection&lt;DistributedObject&gt; objects = hazelcastInstance.getDistributedObjects(); for ( DistributedObject distributedObject : objects ) { if ( distributedObject instanceof IMap ) { System.out.println( &quot;There is a map with name: &quot; + distributedObject.getName() ); } } } Package structure change: PartitionService has been moved to package com.hazelcast.core from com.hazelcast.partition. Listener API change: Before 3.0, removeListener methods were taking the Listener object as a parameter. But this caused confusion because same listener object may be used as a parameter for different listener registrations. So we have changed the listener API. addListener methods returns a unique ID and you can remove a listener by using this ID. So you should do the following replacement if needed: IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;map&quot; ); map.addEntryListener( listener, true ); map.removeEntryListener( listener ); with IMap map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;map&quot; ); String listenerId = map.addEntryListener( listener, true ); map.removeEntryListener( listenerId ); IMap changes: tryRemove(K key, long timeout, TimeUnit timeunit) returns boolean indicating whether operation is successful. tryLockAndGet(K key, long time, TimeUnit timeunit) is removed. putAndUnlock(K key, V value) is removed. lockMap(long time, TimeUnit timeunit) and unlockMap() are removed. getMapEntry(K key) is renamed as getEntryView(K key). The returned object's type, MapEntry class is renamed as EntryView. There is no predefined names for merge policies. You just give the full class name of the merge policy implementation. &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy&lt;\/merge-policy&gt; Also MergePolicy interface has been renamed to MapMergePolicy and also returning null from the implemented merge() method causes the existing entry to be removed. IQueue changes: There is no change on IQueue API but there are changes on how IQueue is configured. With Hazelcast 3.0 there will be no backing map configuration for queue. Settings like backup count will be directly configured on queue config. For queue configuration details, please see the Queue section. Transaction API change: In Hazelcast 3.0, transaction API is completely different. Please see the Transactions chapter. ExecutorService API change: Classes MultiTask and DistributedTask have been removed. All the functionality is supported by the newly presented interface IExecutorService. Please see the Executor Service section. LifeCycleService API: The lifecycle has been simplified. pause(), resume(), restart() methods have been removed. AtomicNumber: AtomicNumber class has been renamed to IAtomicLong. ICountDownLatch: await() operation has been removed. We expect users to use await() method with timeout parameters. ISemaphore API: The ISemaphore has been substantially changed. attach(), detach() methods have been removed. In 2.x releases, the default value for max-size eviction policy was cluster_wide_map_size. In 3.x releases, default is PER_NODE. After upgrading, the max-size should be set according to this new default, if it is not changed. Otherwise, it is likely that OutOfMemory exception may be thrown.","tags":"","url":"Getting_Started\/Upgrading_From_2x.html"},{"title":"Upgrading From 3x","text":"Upgrading from 3.6.x to 3.7.x when using JCache: Hazelcast 3.7 introduced changes in JCache implementation which broke compatibility of 3.6.x clients to 3.7-3.7.2 cluster members and vice versa, so 3.7-3.7.2 clients are also incompatible with 3.6.x cluster members. This issue only affects Java clients which use JCache functionality. Starting with Hazelcast version 3.7.3, a compatibility option is provided which can be used to ensure backwards compatibility with 3.6.x clients. In order to upgrade a 3.6.x cluster and clients to 3.7.3 (or later), you will need to use this compatibility option on either the member or the client side, depending on which one is upgraded first: first upgrade your cluster members to 3.7.3, adding property hazelcast.compatibility.3.6.client=true to your configuration; when started with this property, cluster members are compatible with 3.6.x and 3.7.3+ clients but not with 3.7-3.7.2 clients. Once your cluster is upgraded, you may upgrade your applications to use client version 3.7.3+. upgrade your clients from 3.6.x to 3.7.3, adding property hazelcast.compatibility.3.6.server=true to your Hazelcast client configuration. A 3.7.3 client started with this compatibility option is compatible with 3.6.x and 3.7.3+ cluster members but incompatible with 3.7-3.7.2 cluster members. Once your clients are upgraded, you may then proceed to upgrade your cluster members to version 3.7.3 or later. You may use any of the supported ways as described in the System Properties section to configure the compatibility option. When done upgrading your cluster and clients, you may remove the compatibility property from your Hazelcast member configuration. Introducing the spring-aware element: Before the release 3.5, Hazelcast uses SpringManagedContext to scan SpringAware annotations by default. This may cause some performance overhead for the users who do not use SpringAware. This behavior has been changed with the release of Hazelcast 3.5. SpringAware annotations are disabled by default. By introducing the spring-aware element, now it is possible to enable it by adding the &lt;hz:spring-aware \/&gt; tag to the configuration. Please see the Spring Integration section. Introducing new configuration options for WAN replication: Starting with the release 3.6, WAN replication related system properties, which are configured on a per member basis, can now be configured per target cluster. The 4 system properties below are no longer valid. hazelcast.enterprise.wanrep.batch.size, please see the WAN Replication Batch Size. hazelcast.enterprise.wanrep.batchfrequency.seconds, please see the WAN Replication Batch Maximum Delay. hazelcast.enterprise.wanrep.optimeout.millis, please see the WAN Replication Response Timeout. hazelcast.enterprise.wanrep.queue.capacity, please see the WAN Replication Queue Capacity. Removal of deprecated getId() method: The method getId() in the interface DistributedObject has been removed. Please use the method getName() instead. Change in the Custom Serialization in the C++ Client Distribution: Before, the method getTypeId() was used to retrieve the ID of the object to be serialized. Now, the method getHazelcastTypeId() is used and you give your object as a parameter to this new method. Also, getTypeId() was used in your custom serializer class, now it has been renamed to getHazelcastTypeId() too. Note that, these changes also apply when you want to switch from Hazelcast 3.6.1 to 3.6.2 too. Important note about Hazelcast System Properties: Even Hazelcast has not been recommending the usage of GroupProperties.java class while benefiting from System Properties, there has been a change to inform to the users who have been using this class. Starting with 3.7, the class GroupProperties.java has been replaced by GroupProperty.java. In this new class, system properties are instances of the newly introduced HazelcastProperty object. You can access the names of these properties by calling getName() method of HazelcastProperty.","tags":"","url":"Getting_Started\/Upgrading_From_3x.html"},{"title":"Starting The Member And Client","text":"Having installed Hazelcast, you can get started. In this short tutorial, you perform the following activities. Create a simple Java application using the Hazelcast distributed map and queue. Run our application twice to have a cluster with two members (JVMs). Connect to our cluster from another Java application by using the Hazelcast Native Java Client API. Let's begin. The following code starts the first Hazelcast member and creates and uses the customers map and queue. import com.hazelcast.core.*; import com.hazelcast.config.*; import java.util.Map; import java.util.Queue; public class GettingStarted { public static void main(String[] args) { Config cfg = new Config(); HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(cfg); Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; mapCustomers = instance.getMap(&quot;customers&quot;); mapCustomers.put(1, &quot;Joe&quot;); mapCustomers.put(2, &quot;Ali&quot;); mapCustomers.put(3, &quot;Avi&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Customer with key 1: &quot;+ mapCustomers.get(1)); System.out.println(&quot;Map Size:&quot; + mapCustomers.size()); Queue&lt;String&gt; queueCustomers = instance.getQueue(&quot;customers&quot;); queueCustomers.offer(&quot;Tom&quot;); queueCustomers.offer(&quot;Mary&quot;); queueCustomers.offer(&quot;Jane&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;First customer: &quot; + queueCustomers.poll()); System.out.println(&quot;Second customer: &quot;+ queueCustomers.peek()); System.out.println(&quot;Queue size: &quot; + queueCustomers.size()); } } Run this GettingStarted class a second time to get the second member started. The members form a cluster and the output is similar to the following. Members [2] { Member [127.0.0.1:5701] Member [127.0.0.1:5702] this } Now, add the hazelcast-client-&lt;version&gt;.jar library to your classpath. This is required to use a Hazelcast client. The following code starts a Hazelcast Client, connects to our cluster, and prints the size of the customers map. package com.hazelcast.test; import com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig; import com.hazelcast.client.HazelcastClient; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.IMap; public class GettingStartedClient { public static void main( String[] args ) { ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient( clientConfig ); IMap map = client.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); System.out.println( &quot;Map Size:&quot; + map.size() ); } } When you run it, you see the client properly connecting to the cluster and printing the map size as 3. Hazelcast also offers a tool, Management Center, that enables you to monitor your cluster. To use it, deploy the mancenter-&lt;version&gt;.war included in the ZIP file to your web server. You can use it to monitor your maps, queues, and other distributed data structures and members. Please see the Management Center section for usage explanations. By default, Hazelcast uses Multicast to discover other members that can form a cluster. If you are working with other Hazelcast developers on the same network, you may find yourself joining their clusters under the default settings. Hazelcast provides a way to segregate clusters within the same network when using Multicast. Please see the Creating Cluster Groups for more information. Alternatively, if you do not wish to use the default Multicast mechanism, you can provide a fixed list of IP addresses that are allowed to join. Please see the Join Configuration section for more information.

It provides elastically scalable distributed In-Memory computing, widely recognized as the fastest and most scalable approach to application performance. Hazelcast does this in open source. More importantly, Hazelcast makes distributed computing simple by offering distributed implementations of many developer-friendly interfaces from Java such as Map, Queue, ExecutorService, Lock, and JCache. For example, the Map interface provides an In-Memory Key Value store which confers many of the advantages of NoSQL in terms of developer friendliness and developer productivity. In addition to distributing data In-Memory, Hazelcast provides a convenient set of APIs to access the CPUs in your cluster for maximum processing speed. Hazelcast is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Since Hazelcast is delivered as a compact library (JAR) and since it has no external dependencies other than Java, it easily plugs into your software solution and provides distributed data structures and distributed computing utilities. Hazelcast is highly scalable and available (100% operational, never failing). Distributed applications can use Hazelcast for distributed caching, synchronization, clustering, processing, pub\/sub messaging, etc. Hazelcast is implemented in Java and has clients for Java, C\/C++, .NET and REST. Hazelcast also speaks memcache protocol. It plugs into Hibernate and can easily be used with any existing database system. If you are looking for In-Memory speed, elastic scalability, and the developer friendliness of NoSQL, Hazelcast is a great choice. Hazelcast is Simple Hazelcast is written in Java with no other dependencies. It exposes the same API from the familiar Java util package, exposing the same interfaces. Just add hazelcast.jar to your classpath and you can quickly enjoy JVMs clustering and start building scalable applications. Hazelcast is Peer-to-Peer Unlike many NoSQL solutions, Hazelcast is peer-to-peer. There is no master and slave; there is no single point of failure. All members store equal amounts of data and do equal amounts of processing. You can embed Hazelcast in your existing application or use it in client and server mode where your application is a client to Hazelcast members. Hazelcast is Scalable Hazelcast is designed to scale up to hundreds and thousands of members. Simply add new members and they will automatically discover the cluster and will linearly increase both memory and processing capacity. The members maintain a TCP connection between each other and all communication is performed through this layer. Hazelcast is Fast Hazelcast stores everything in-memory. It is designed to perform very fast reads and updates. Hazelcast is Redundant Hazelcast keeps the backup of each data entry on multiple members. On a member failure, the data is restored from the backup and the cluster will continue to operate without downtime.","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_Overview\/index.html"},{"title":"Sharding In Hazelcast","text":"Hazelcast shards are called Partitions. By default, Hazelcast has 271 partitions. Given a key, we serialize, hash and mod it with the number of partitions to find the partition which the key belongs to.

If you have an application whose main focal point is asynchronous or high performance computing and lots of task executions, then Embedded deployment is useful. In Embedded deployment, members include both the application and Hazelcast data and services. The advantage of the Embedded deployment is having a low-latency data access. See the below illustration. In the Client\/Server deployment, Hazelcast data and services are centralized in one or more server members and they are accessed by the application through clients. You can have a cluster of server members that can be independently created and scaled. Your clients communicate with these members to reach to Hazelcast data and services on them. Hazelcast provides native clients (Java, .NET and C++), Memcache clients and REST clients. See the illustration at the end of this section. Client\/Server deployment has advantages including more predictable and reliable Hazelcast performance, easier identification of problem causes, and most importantly, better scalability. When you need to scale in this deployment type, just add more Hazelcast server members. You can address client and server scalability concerns separately. If you want low-latency data access, as in the Embedded deployment, and you also want the scalability advantages of the Client\/Server deployment, you can consider defining near caches for your clients. This enables the frequently used data to be kept in the client's local memory. Please refer to Configuring Client Near Cache.","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_Overview\/Hazelcast_Topology.html"},{"title":"Why Hazelcast","text":"A Glance at Traditional Data Persistence Data is at the core of software systems. In conventional architectures, a relational database persists and provides access to data. Applications are talking directly with a database which has its backup as another machine. To increase performance, tuning or a faster machine is required. This can cost a large amount of money or effort. There is also the idea of keeping copies of data next to the database, which is performed using technologies like external key-value stores or second level caching that help offload the database. However, when the database is saturated or the applications perform mostly &quot;put&quot; operations (writes), this approach is of no use because it insulates the database only from the &quot;get&quot; loads (reads). Even if the applications are read-intensive there can be consistency problems--when data changes, what happens to the cache, and how are the changes handled? This is when concepts like time-to-live (TTL) or write-through come in. In the case of TTL, if the access is less frequent than the TTL, the result will always be a cache miss. On the other hand, in the case of write-through caches, if there are more than one of these caches in a cluster, we again will have consistency issues. This can be avoided by having the nodes communicate with each other so that entry invalidations can be propagated. We can conclude that an ideal cache would combine TTL and write-through features. There are several cache servers and in-memory database solutions in this field. However, these are stand-alone single instances with a distribution mechanism that is provided by other technologies to an extent. So, we are back to square one; we experience saturation or capacity issues if the product is a single instance or if consistency is not provided by the distribution. And, there is Hazelcast Hazelcast, a brand new approach to data, is designed around the concept of distribution. Hazelcast shares data around the cluster for flexibility and performance. It is an in-memory data grid for clustering and highly scalable data distribution. One of the main features of Hazelcast is that it does not have a master member. Each cluster member is configured to be the same in terms of functionality. The oldest member (the first member created in the cluster) automatically performs the data assignment to cluster members. If the oldest member dies, the second oldest member takes over. Another main feature of Hazelcast is that the data is held entirely in-memory. This is fast. In the case of a failure, such as a member crash, no data will be lost since Hazelcast distributes copies of the data across all the cluster members. As shown in the feature list in the Hazelcast Overview, Hazelcast supports a number of distributed data structures and distributed computing utilities. These provide powerful ways of accessing distributed clustered memory and accessing CPUs for true distributed computing. Hazelcast's Distinctive Strengths Hazelcast is open source. Hazelcast is only a JAR file. You do not need to install software. Hazelcast is a library, it does not impose an architecture on Hazelcast users. Hazelcast provides out of the box distributed data structures, such as Map, Queue, MultiMap, Topic, Lock and Executor. There is no &quot;master,&quot; meaning no single point of failure in a Hazelcast cluster; each member in the cluster is configured to be functionally the same. When the size of your memory and compute requirements increase, new members can be dynamically joined to the Hazelcast cluster to scale elastically. Data is resilient to member failure. Data backups are distributed across the cluster. This is a big benefit when a member in the cluster crashes as data will not be lost. Members are always aware of each other unlike in traditional key-value caching solutions. You can build your own custom-distributed data structures using the Service Programming Interface (SPI) if you are not happy with the data structures provided. Finally, Hazelcast has a vibrant open source community enabling it to be continuously developed. Hazelcast is a fit when you need: analytic applications requiring big data processing by partitioning the data. to retain frequently accessed data in the grid. a cache, particularly an open source JCache provider with elastic distributed scalability. a primary data store for applications with utmost performance, scalability and low-latency requirements. an In-Memory NoSQL Key Value Store. publish\/subscribe communication at highest speed and scalability between applications. applications that need to scale elastically in distributed and cloud environments. a highly available distributed cache for applications. an alternative to Coherence and Terracotta.","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_Overview\/Why_Hazelcast.html"},{"title":"Data Partitioning","text":"As you read in the Sharding in Hazelcast section, Hazelcast shards are called Partitions. Partitions are memory segments that can contain hundreds or thousands of data entries each, depending on the memory capacity of your system. By default, Hazelcast offers 271 partitions. When you start a cluster member, it starts with these 271 partitions. The following illustration shows the partitions in a Hazelcast cluster with single member. When you start a second member on that cluster (creating a Hazelcast cluster with two members), the partitions are distributed as shown in the illustration here. In the illustration, the partitions with black text are primary partitions and the partitions with blue text are replica partitions (backups). The first member has 135 primary partitions (black), and each of these partitions are backed up in the second member (blue). At the same time, the first member also has the replica partitions of the second member's primary partitions. As you add more members, Hazelcast moves some of the primary and replica partitions to the new members one by one, making all members equal and redundant. Only the minimum amount of partitions will be moved to scale out Hazelcast. The following is an illustration of the partition distributions in a Hazelcast cluster with four members. Hazelcast distributes the partitions equally among the members of the cluster. Hazelcast creates the backups of partitions and distributes them among the members for redundancy. NOTE: Each partition can have multiple backups depending on your backup count. Please see the Backing Up Maps section. Partition distributions in the above illustrations are for your convenience and descriptive purposes. Normally, the partitions are not distributed in an order (as they are shown in these illustrations), but are distributed randomly. The important point here is that Hazelcast equally distributes the partitions and their backups among the members. Starting with Hazelcast 3.6, lite members are introduced. Lite members are a new type of members that do not own any partition. Lite members are intended for use in computationally-heavy task executions and listener registrations. Although they do not own any partitions, they can access partitions that are owned by other members in the cluster. RELATED INFORMATION Please refer to the Enabling Lite Members section. How the Data is Partitioned Hazelcast distributes data entries into the partitions using a hashing algorithm. Given an object key (for example, for a map) or an object name (for example, for a topic or list): the key or name is serialized (converted into a byte array), this byte array is hashed, and the result of the hash is mod by the number of partitions. The result of this modulo - MOD(hash result, partition count) - is the partition in which the data will be stored, that is the partition ID. For ALL members you have in your cluster, the partition ID for a given key will always be the same. Partition Table When you start a member, a partition table is created within it. This table stores the partition IDs and the cluster members to which they belong. The purpose of this table is to make all members (including lite members) in the cluster aware of this information, making sure that each member knows where the data is. The oldest member in the cluster (the one that started first) periodically sends the partition table to all members. In this way each member in the cluster is informed about any changes to partition ownership. The ownerships may be changed when, for example, a new member joins the cluster, or when a member leaves the cluster. NOTE: If the oldest member of the cluster goes down, the next oldest member sends the partition table information to the other ones. You can configure the frequency (how often) that the member sends the partition table the information by using the hazelcast.partition.table.send.interval system property. The property is set to every 15 seconds by default. Repartitioning Repartitioning is the process of redistribution of partition ownerships. Hazelcast performs the repartitioning in the following cases: When a member joins to the cluster. When a member leaves the cluster. In these cases, the partition table in the oldest member is updated with the new partition ownerships. Note that if a lite member joins or leaves a cluster, repartitioning is not triggered since lite members do not own any partitions.","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_Overview\/Data_Partitioning.html"},{"title":"Use Cases","text":"Hazelcast can be used: to share server configuration\/information to see how a cluster performs. to cluster highly changing data with event notifications, e.g., user based events, and to queue and distribute background tasks. as a simple Memcache with near cache. as a cloud-wide scheduler of certain processes that need to be performed on some members. to share information (user information, queues, maps, etc.) on the fly with multiple members in different installations under OSGI environments. to share thousands of keys in a cluster where there is a web service interface on an application server and some validation. as a distributed topic (publish\/subscribe server) to build scalable chat servers for smartphones. as a front layer for a Cassandra back-end. to distribute user object states across the cluster, to pass messages between objects, and to share system data structures (static initialization state, mirrored objects, object identity generators). as a multi-tenancy cache where each tenant has its own map. to share datasets, e.g., table-like data structure, to be used by applications. to distribute the load and collect status from Amazon EC2 servers where the front-end is developed using, for example, Spring framework. as a real-time streamer for performance detection. as storage for session data in web applications (enables horizontal scalability of the web application).","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_Overview\/Use_Cases.html"},{"title":"Resources","text":"Hazelcast source code can be found at Github\/Hazelcast.

The cluster members do not need to know the concrete addresses of the other members, as they just multicast to all the other members for listening. Whether multicast is possible or allowed depends on your environment. To set your Hazelcast to multicast auto-discovery, set the following configuration elements. Please refer to the multicast element section for the full description of the multicast discovery configuration elements. Set the enabled attribute of the multicast element to &quot;true&quot;.

This only applies to the startup of members where no leader has been assigned yet. If you specify a high value to multicast-timeout-seconds, such as 60 seconds, it means that until a leader is selected, each member will wait 60 seconds before moving on. Be careful when providing a high value. Also, be careful not to set the value too low, or the members might give up too early and create their own cluster.

For this purpose Hazelcast offers a distributed dynamic class loader. Using this dynamic class loader, you can control the local caching of the classes loaded from other members, control the classes to be served to other members, and create blacklists or whitelists of classes and packages. When you enable this feature, you will not have to deploy your classes to all cluster members. The following is the brief working mechanism of the User Code Deployment feature: Dynamic class loader first checks the local classes, i.e., your classpath, for your custom class. If it is there, Hazelcast does not try to load it from the remote class repository. Then, it checks the cache of classes loaded from the remote class repository (for this, caching should have been enabled in your local, please refer to the Configuring User Code Deployment section below. If your class is found here, again, Hazelcast does not try to load it from the remote class repository. Finally, dynamic class loader checks the remote class repository. If a member in this repository returns the class, it means your class is found and will be used. You can also put this class into your local class cache as mentioned in the previous step. Configuring User Code Deployment User Code Deployment feature is not enabled by default. You can configure this feature declaratively or programmatically. Following are example configuration snippets: Declarative Configuration &lt;user-code-deployment enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;class-cache-mode&gt;ETERNAL&lt;\/class-cache-mode&gt; &lt;provider-mode&gt;LOCAL_CLASSES_ONLY&lt;\/provider-mode&gt; &lt;blacklist-prefixes&gt;com.foo&lt;\/blacklist-prefixes&gt; &lt;whitelist-prefixes&gt;com.bar.MyClass&lt;\/whitelist-prefixes&gt; &lt;provider-filter&gt;HAS_ATTRIBUTE:lite&lt;provider-filter&gt; &lt;\/user-code-deployment&gt; Programmatic Configuration Config config = new Config(); UserCodeDeploymentConfig distCLConfig = config.getUserCodeDeploymentConfig(); distCLConfig.setEnabled( true ) .setClassCacheMode( &quot;ETERNAL&quot; ) .setProviderMode( &quot;LOCAL_CLASSES_ONLY&quot; ) .setBlacklistedPrefixes( &quot;com.foo&quot; ) .setWhitelistPrefixes( &quot;com.bar.MyClass&quot; ) .setProviderFilter( &quot;HAS_ATTRIBUTE:lite&quot; ); User Code Deployment has the following configuration elements and attributes: enabled: Specifies whether dynamic class loading is enabled or not. Its default value is &quot;true&quot; and it is a mandatory attribute. &lt;class-cache-mode&gt;: Controls the local caching behavior for the classes loaded from the remote class repository. Available values are as follows: ETERNAL: Cache the loaded classes locally. This is the default value and suitable when you load long-living objects, such as domain objects stored in a map. OFF: Do not cache the loaded classes locally. It is suitable for loading runnables, callables, entry processors, etc. &lt;provider-mode&gt;: Controls how the classes are served to the other cluster members. Available values are as follows: LOCAL_AND_CACHED_CLASSES: Serve classes loaded from both local classpath and from other members. This is the default value. LOCAL_CLASSES_ONLY: Serve classes from the local classpath only. Classes loaded from other members will be used locally, but they are not served to other members. OFF: Never serve classes to other members. &lt;blacklist-prefixes&gt;: Comma separated name prefixes of classes\/packages to be prevented from dynamic class loading.

Those partitions are assigned to members. An entry is stored in the member that owns the partition to which the entry's key is assigned. The total partition count is 271 by default; you can change it with the configuration property hazelcast.partition.count. Please see the System Properties section. Along with those partitions, there are also copies of the partitions as backups. Backup partitions can have multiple copies due to the backup count defined in configuration, such as first backup partition, second backup partition, etc. A member cannot hold more than one copy of a partition (ownership or backup). By default, Hazelcast distributes partitions and their backup copies randomly and equally among cluster members, assuming all members in the cluster are identical. But what if some members share the same JVM or physical machine or chassis and you want backups of these members to be assigned to members in another machine or chassis? What if processing or memory capacities of some members are different and you do not want an equal number of partitions to be assigned to all members? You can group members in the same JVM (or physical machine) or members located in the same chassis. Or you can group members to create identical capacity. We call these groups partition groups. Partitions are assigned to those partition groups instead of to single members. Backups of these partitions are located in another partition group. Grouping Types When you enable partition grouping, Hazelcast presents the following choices for you to configure partition groups. 1. HOST_AWARE: You can group members automatically using the IP addresses of members, so members sharing the same network interface will be grouped together. All members on the same host (IP address or domain name) will be a single partition group. This helps to avoid data loss when a physical server crashes, because multiple replicas of the same partition are not stored on the same host. But if there are multiple network interfaces or domain names per physical machine, that will make this assumption invalid. Following are declarative and programmatic configuration snippets that show how to enable HOST_AWARE grouping. &lt;partition-group enabled=&quot;true&quot; group-type=&quot;HOST_AWARE&quot; \/&gt; Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true ) .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.HOST_AWARE ); 2. CUSTOM: You can do custom grouping using Hazelcast's interface matching configuration. This way, you can add different and multiple interfaces to a group. You can also use wildcards in the interface addresses. For example, the users can create rack-aware or data warehouse partition groups using custom partition grouping. Following are declarative and programmatic configuration examples that show how to enable and use CUSTOM grouping. &lt;partition-group enabled=&quot;true&quot; group-type=&quot;CUSTOM&quot;&gt; &lt;member-group&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.10.0.*&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.10.3.*&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.10.5.*&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;\/member-group&gt; &lt;member-group&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.10.10.10-100&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.10.1.*&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.10.2.*&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;\/member-group &lt;\/partition-group&gt; Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true ) .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.CUSTOM ); MemberGroupConfig memberGroupConfig = new MemberGroupConfig(); memberGroupConfig.addInterface( &quot;10.10.0.*&quot; ) .addInterface( &quot;10.10.3.*&quot; ).addInterface(&quot;10.10.5.*&quot; ); MemberGroupConfig memberGroupConfig2 = new MemberGroupConfig(); memberGroupConfig2.addInterface( &quot;10.10.10.10-100&quot; ) .addInterface( &quot;10.10.1.*&quot;).addInterface( &quot;10.10.2.*&quot; ); partitionGroupConfig.addMemberGroupConfig( memberGroupConfig ); partitionGroupConfig.addMemberGroupConfig( memberGroupConfig2 ); 3. PER_MEMBER: You can give every member its own group. Each member is a group of its own and primary and backup partitions are distributed randomly (not on the same physical member). This gives the least amount of protection and is the default configuration for a Hazelcast cluster. This grouping type provides good redundancy when Hazelcast members are on separate hosts. However, if multiple instances run on the same host, this type is not a good option. Following are declarative and programmatic configuration snippets that show how to enable PER_MEMBER grouping. &lt;partition-group enabled=&quot;true&quot; group-type=&quot;PER_MEMBER&quot; \/&gt; Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true ) .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.PER_MEMBER ); 4. ZONE_AWARE: You can use ZONE_AWARE configuration with Hazelcast jclouds or Hazelcast Azure Discovery Service plugins. As discovery services, these plugins put zone, rack, and host information to the Hazelcast member attributes map during the discovery process. Hazelcast creates the partition groups with respect to member attributes map entries that include zone, rack, and host information. When using ZONE_AWARE configuration, backups are created in the other zones. Each zone will be accepted as one partition group. NOTE: Some cloud providers have rack information instead of zone information. In such cases, Hazelcast looks for zone, rack, and host information in the given order. Following are declarative and programmatic configuration snippets that show how to enable ZONE_AWARE grouping. &lt;partition-group enabled=&quot;true&quot; group-type=&quot;ZONE_AWARE&quot; \/&gt; Config config = ...; PartitionGroupConfig partitionGroupConfig = config.getPartitionGroupConfig(); partitionGroupConfig.setEnabled( true ) .setGroupType( MemberGroupType.ZONE_AWARE ); NOTE: Currently ZONE_AWARE configuration works only with Hazelcast jclouds and Hazelcast Azure Discovery Service plugins. Please refer to their GitHub repositories at Hazelcast jclouds and Hazelcast Azure for more information on these plugins. 5. SPI: You can provide your own partition group implementation using the SPI configuration. To create your partition group implementation, you need to first extend the DiscoveryStrategy class of the discovery service plugin, override the method public PartitionGroupStrategy getPartitionGroupStrategy(), and return the PartitionGroupStrategy configuration in that overridden method. Following is a sample code covering the implementation steps mentioned in the above paragraph: public class CustomDiscovery extends JCloudsDiscoveryStrategy { public CustomDiscovery(Map&lt;String, Comparable&gt; properties) { super(properties); } @Override public PartitionGroupStrategy getPartitionGroupStrategy() { return new CustomPartitionGroupStrategy(); } private class CustomPartitionGroupStrategy implements PartitionGroupStrategy { @Override public Iterable&lt;MemberGroup&gt; getMemberGroups() { ... ... } } }","tags":"","url":"Setting_Up_Clusters\/Partition_Group_Configuration.html"},{"title":"Logging Configuration","text":"Hazelcast has a flexible logging configuration and does not depend on any logging framework except JDK logging. It has built-in adapters for a number of logging frameworks and it also supports custom loggers by providing logging interfaces.

Following subsections describe the available configurations that you can perform under the network element. Public Address public-address overrides the public address of a member. By default, a member selects its socket address as its public address. But behind a network address translation (NAT), two endpoints (members) may not be able to see\/access each other. If both members set their public addresses to their defined addresses on NAT, then that way they can communicate with each other. In this case, their public addresses are not an address of a local network interface but a virtual address defined by NAT. It is optional to set and useful when you have a private cloud. Note that, the value for this element should be given in the format host IP address:port number. See the following examples. Declarative: &lt;network&gt; &lt;public-address&gt;11.22.33.44:5555&lt;\/public-address&gt; &lt;\/network&gt; Programmatic: Config config = new Config(); config.getNetworkConfig() .setPublicAddress( &quot;11.22.33.44&quot;, &quot;5555&quot; ); Port You can specify the ports that Hazelcast will use to communicate between cluster members. Its default value is 5701. The following are example configurations. Declarative: &lt;network&gt; &lt;port port-count=&quot;20&quot; auto-increment=&quot;false&quot;&gt;5701&lt;\/port&gt; &lt;\/network&gt; Programmatic: Config config = new Config(); config.getNetworkConfig().setPort( &quot;5701&quot; ); .setPortCount( &quot;20&quot; ).setPortAutoIncrement( false ); port has the following attributes. port-count: By default, Hazelcast will try 100 ports to bind. Meaning that, if you set the value of port as 5701, as members are joining to the cluster, Hazelcast tries to find ports between 5701 and 5801. You can choose to change the port count in the cases like having large instances on a single machine or willing to have only a few ports to be assigned. The parameter port-count is used for this purpose, whose default value is 100. auto-increment: According to the above example, Hazelcast will try to find free ports between 5701 and 5801. Normally, you will not need to change this value, but it will come very handy when needed. You may also want to choose to use only one port. In that case, you can disable the auto-increment feature of port by setting auto-increment to false. The parameter port-count is ignored when the above configuration is made. Outbound Ports By default, Hazelcast lets the system pick up an ephemeral port during socket bind operation. But security policies\/firewalls may require you to restrict outbound ports to be used by Hazelcast-enabled applications. To fulfill this requirement, you can configure Hazelcast to use only defined outbound ports. The following are example configurations. Declarative: &lt;network&gt; &lt;outbound-ports&gt; &lt;!-- ports between 33000 and 35000 --&gt; &lt;ports&gt;33000-35000&lt;\/ports&gt; &lt;!-- comma separated ports --&gt; &lt;ports&gt;37000,37001,37002,37003&lt;\/ports&gt; &lt;ports&gt;38000,38500-38600&lt;\/ports&gt; &lt;\/outbound-ports&gt; &lt;\/network&gt; Programmatic: ... NetworkConfig networkConfig = config.getNetworkConfig(); \/\/ ports between 35000 and 35100 networkConfig.addOutboundPortDefinition(&quot;35000-35100&quot;); \/\/ comma separated ports networkConfig.addOutboundPortDefinition(&quot;36001, 36002, 36003&quot;); networkConfig.addOutboundPort(37000); networkConfig.addOutboundPort(37001); ... Note: You can use port ranges and\/or comma separated ports. As shown in the programmatic configuration, you use the method addOutboundPort to add only one port. If you need to add a group of ports, then use the method addOutboundPortDefinition. In the declarative configuration, the element ports can be used for both single and multiple port definitions. Reuse Address When you shutdown a cluster member, the server socket port will be in the TIME_WAIT state for the next couple of minutes. If you start the member right after shutting it down, you may not be able to bind it to the same port because it is in the TIME_WAIT state. If you set the reuse-address element to true, the TIME_WAIT state is ignored and you can bind the member to the same port again. The following are example configurations. Declarative: &lt;network&gt; &lt;reuse-address&gt;true&lt;\/reuse-address&gt; &lt;\/network&gt; Programmatic: ... NetworkConfig networkConfig = config.getNetworkConfig(); networkConfig.setReuseAddress( true ); ... Join The join configuration element is used to discover Hazelcast members and enable them to form a cluster. Hazelcast provides multicast, TCP\/IP, EC2, and jclouds\u00c2\u00ae discovery mechanisms. These mechanisms are explained the Discovering Cluster Members section. This section describes all the sub-elements and attributes of join element. The following are example configurations. Declarative: &lt;network&gt; &lt;join&gt; &lt;multicast enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;multicast-group&gt;224.2.2.3&lt;\/multicast-group&gt; &lt;multicast-port&gt;54327&lt;\/multicast-port&gt; &lt;multicast-time-to-live&gt;32&lt;\/multicast-time-to-live&gt; &lt;multicast-timeout-seconds&gt;2&lt;\/multicast-timeout-seconds&gt; &lt;trusted-interfaces&gt; &lt;interface&gt;192.168.1.102&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;\/trusted-interfaces&gt; &lt;\/multicast&gt; &lt;tcp-ip enabled=&quot;false&quot;&gt; &lt;required-member&gt;192.168.1.104&lt;\/required-member&gt; &lt;member&gt;192.168.1.104&lt;\/member&gt; &lt;members&gt;192.168.1.105,192.168.1.106&lt;\/members&gt; &lt;\/tcp-ip&gt; &lt;aws enabled=&quot;false&quot;&gt; &lt;access-key&gt;my-access-key&lt;\/access-key&gt; &lt;secret-key&gt;my-secret-key&lt;\/secret-key&gt; &lt;region&gt;us-west-1&lt;\/region&gt; &lt;host-header&gt;ec2.amazonaws.com&lt;\/host-header&gt; &lt;security-group-name&gt;hazelcast-sg&lt;\/security-group-name&gt; &lt;tag-key&gt;type&lt;\/tag-key&gt; &lt;tag-value&gt;hz-members&lt;\/tag-value&gt; &lt;\/aws&gt; &lt;discovery-strategies&gt; &lt;discovery-strategy ... \/&gt; &lt;\/discovery-strategies&gt; &lt;\/join&gt; &lt;network&gt; Programmatic: Config config = new Config(); NetworkConfig network = config.getNetworkConfig(); JoinConfig join = network.getJoin(); join.getMulticastConfig().setEnabled( false ) .addTrustedInterface( &quot;192.168.1.102&quot; ); join.getTcpIpConfig().addMember( &quot;10.45.67.32&quot; ).addMember( &quot;10.45.67.100&quot; ) .setRequiredMember( &quot;192.168.10.100&quot; ).setEnabled( true ); The join element has the following sub-elements and attributes. multicast element The multicast element includes parameters to fine tune the multicast join mechanism. enabled: Specifies whether the multicast discovery is enabled or not, true or false. multicast-group: The multicast group IP address. Specify it when you want to create clusters within the same network. Values can be between 224.0.0.0 and 239.255.255.255. Default value is 224.2.2.3. multicast-port: The multicast socket port that the Hazelcast member listens to and sends discovery messages through. Default value is 54327. multicast-time-to-live: Time-to-live value for multicast packets sent out to control the scope of multicasts. See more information here. multicast-timeout-seconds: Only when the members are starting up, this timeout (in seconds) specifies the period during which a member waits for a multicast response from another member. For example, if you set it as 60 seconds, each member will wait for 60 seconds until a leader member is selected. Its default value is 2 seconds. trusted-interfaces: Includes IP addresses of trusted members. When a member wants to join to the cluster, its join request will be rejected if it is not a trusted member. You can give an IP addresses range using the wildcard (*) on the last digit of IP address, e.g., 192.168.1.* or 192.168.1.100-110. tcp-ip element The tcp-ip element includes parameters to fine tune the TCP\/IP join mechanism. enabled: Specifies whether the TCP\/IP discovery is enabled or not. Values can be true or false. required-member: IP address of the required member. Cluster will only formed if the member with this IP address is found. member: IP address(es) of one or more well known members. Once members are connected to these well known ones, all member addresses will be communicated with each other. You can also give comma separated IP addresses using the members element. NOTE: tcp-ip element also accepts the interface parameter. Please refer to the Interfaces element description below. connection-timeout-seconds: Defines the connection timeout. This is the maximum amount of time Hazelcast is going to try to connect to a well known member before giving up. Setting it to a too low value could mean that a member is not able to connect to a cluster. Setting it to a too high value means that member startup could slow down because of longer timeouts, for example when a well known member is not up. Increasing this value is recommended if you have many IPs listed and the members cannot properly build up the cluster. Its default value is 5. aws element The aws element includes parameters to allow the members to form a cluster on the Amazon EC2 environment. enabled: Specifies whether the EC2 discovery is enabled or not, true or false. access-key, secret-key: Access and secret keys of your account on EC2. region: The region where your members are running. Default value is us-east-1. You need to specify this if the region is other than the default one. host-header: The URL that is the entry point for a web service. It is optional. security-group-name: Name of the security group you specified at the EC2 management console. It is used to narrow the Hazelcast members to be within this group. It is optional. tag-key, tag-value: To narrow the members in the cloud down to only Hazelcast members, you can set these parameters as the ones you specified in the EC2 console. They are optional. connection-timeout-seconds: The maximum amount of time Hazelcast will try to connect to a well known member before giving up. Setting this value too low could mean that a member is not able to connect to a cluster. Setting the value too high means that member startup could slow down because of longer timeouts (for example, when a well known member is not up). Increasing this value is recommended if you have many IPs listed and the members cannot properly build up the cluster. Its default value is 5. If you are using a cloud provider other than AWS, you can use the programmatic configuration to specify a TCP\/IP cluster. The members will need to be retrieved from that provider, e.g., jclouds. discovery-strategies element The discovery-strategies element configures internal or external discovery strategies based on the Hazelcast Discovery SPI. For further information, please refer to the Discovery SPI section and the vendor documentation of the used discovery strategy. AWSClient Configuration To make sure EC2 instances are found correctly, you can use the AWSClient class. It determines the private IP addresses of EC2 instances to be connected. Give the AWSClient class the values for the parameters that you specified in the aws element, as shown below. You will see whether your EC2 instances are found. public static void main( String[] args )throws Exception{ AwsConfig config = new AwsConfig(); config.setSecretKey( ... ) ; config.setSecretKey( ... ); config.setRegion( ... ); config.setSecurityGroupName( ... ); config.setTagKey( ... ); config.setTagValue( ... ); config.setEnabled( true ); AWSClient client = new AWSClient( config ); List&lt;String&gt; ipAddresses = client.getPrivateIpAddresses(); System.out.println( &quot;addresses found:&quot; + ipAddresses ); for ( String ip: ipAddresses ) { System.out.println( ip ); } } Interfaces You can specify which network interfaces that Hazelcast should use. Servers mostly have more than one network interface, so you may want to list the valid IPs. Range characters ('*' and '-') can be used for simplicity. For instance, 10.3.10.* refers to IPs between 10.3.10.0 and 10.3.10.255. Interface 10.3.10.4-18 refers to IPs between 10.3.10.4 and 10.3.10.18 (4 and 18 included). If network interface configuration is enabled (it is disabled by default) and if Hazelcast cannot find an matching interface, then it will print a message on the console and will not start on that member. The following are example configurations. Declarative: &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;network&gt; ... &lt;interfaces enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.3.16.*&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.3.10.4-18&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;192.168.1.3&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;\/interfaces&gt; &lt;\/network&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; Programmatic: Config config = new Config(); NetworkConfig network = config.getNetworkConfig(); InterfacesConfig interface = network.getInterfaces(); interface.setEnabled( true ) .addInterface( &quot;192.168.1.3&quot; ); IPv6 Support Hazelcast supports IPv6 addresses seamlessly (This support is switched off by default, please see the note at the end of this section). All you need is to define IPv6 addresses or interfaces. The only current limitation is that you cannot define wildcard IPv6 addresses in the TCP\/IP join configuration (tcp-ip element). Interfaces configuration does not have this limitation, you can configure wildcard IPv6 interfaces in the same way as IPv4 interfaces. &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;network&gt; &lt;port auto-increment=&quot;true&quot;&gt;5701&lt;\/port&gt; &lt;join&gt; &lt;multicast enabled=&quot;false&quot;&gt; &lt;multicast-group&gt;FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1&lt;\/multicast-group&gt; &lt;multicast-port&gt;54327&lt;\/multicast-port&gt; &lt;\/multicast&gt; &lt;tcp-ip enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;member&gt;[fe80::223:6cff:fe93:7c7e]:5701&lt;\/member&gt; &lt;interface&gt;192.168.1.0-7&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;192.168.1.*&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;fe80:0:0:0:45c5:47ee:fe15:493a&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;\/tcp-ip&gt; &lt;\/join&gt; &lt;interfaces enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.3.16.*&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;10.3.10.4-18&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;fe80:0:0:0:45c5:47ee:fe15:*&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;interface&gt;fe80::223:6cff:fe93:0-5555&lt;\/interface&gt; &lt;\/interfaces&gt; ... &lt;\/network&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; JVM has two system properties for setting the preferred protocol stack (IPv4 or IPv6) as well as the preferred address family types (inet4 or inet6). On a dual stack machine, IPv6 stack is preferred by default, you can change this through the java.net.preferIPv4Stack=&lt;true|false&gt; system property. When querying name services, JVM prefers IPv4 addresses over IPv6 addresses and will return an IPv4 address if possible. You can change this through java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=&lt;true|false&gt; system property. Also see additional details on IPv6 support in Java. NOTE: IPv6 support has been switched off by default, since some platforms have issues using the IPv6 stack. Some other platforms such as Amazon AWS have no support at all. To enable IPv6 support, just set configuration property hazelcast.prefer.ipv4.stack to false. Please refer to the System Properties section for details.","tags":"","url":"Setting_Up_Clusters\/Other_Network_Configurations.html"},{"title":"Rolling Member Upgrades","text":"Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise This chapter explains the procedure of upgrading the version of Hazelcast members in a running cluster without interrupting the operation of the cluster. Terminology Minor version: A version change after the decimal point, e.g., 3.8 and 3.9. Patch version: A version change after the second decimal point, e.g., 3.8.1 and 3.8.2. Member codebase version: The major.minor.patch version of the Hazelcast binary on which the member executes. For example, when running on hazelcast-3.8.jar, your member's codebase version is 3.8.0. Cluster version: The major.minor version at which the cluster operates. This ensures that cluster members are able to communicate using the same cluster protocol and determines the feature set exposed by the cluster. Hazelcast Members Compatibility Guarantees Hazelcast members operating on binaries of the same major and minor version numbers are compatible regardless of patch version. For example, in a cluster with members running on version 3.7.1, it is possible to perform a rolling upgrade to 3.7.2 by shutting down, upgrading to hazelcast-3.7.2.jar binary and starting each member one by one. Patch level compatibility applies to both Hazelcast IMDG and Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise. Starting with Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise 3.8, each next minor version released will be compatible with the previous one. For example, it will be possible to perform a rolling upgrade on a cluster running Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise 3.8 to Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise 3.9 whenever that is released. Rolling upgrades across minor versions is a Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise feature, starting with version 3.8. The compatibility guarantees described above are given in the context of rolling member upgrades and only apply to GA (general availability) releases. It is never advisable to run a cluster with members running on different patch or minor versions for prolonged periods of time. Rolling Upgrade Procedure NOTE: The version numbers used in the paragraph below are only used as an example. Let's assume a cluster with four members running on codebase version 3.8.0 with cluster version 3.8, that should be upgraded to codebase version 3.9.0 and cluster version 3.9. The rolling upgrade process for this cluster, i.e., replacing existing 3.8.0 members one by one with an upgraded one at version 3.9.0, includes the following steps which should be repeated for each member: Shutdown gracefully an existing 3.8.0 member. Wait until all partition migrations are completed; during migrations, membership changes (member joins or removals) are not allowed. Update the member with the new 3.9.0 Hazelcast binaries. Start the member and wait until it joins the cluster. You should see something like the following in your logs: ... INFO: [192.168.2.2]:5701 [cluster] [3.9] Hazelcast 3.9 (20170630 - a67dc3a) starting at [192.168.2.2]:5701 ... INFO: [192.168.2.2]:5701 [cluster] [3.9] Cluster version set to 3.8 The version in brackets [3.9] still denotes the member's codebase version (running on the hypothetical hazelcast-3.9.jar binary). Once the member locates existing cluster members, it sends its join request to the master. The master validates that the new member is allowed to join the cluster and lets the new member know that the cluster is currently operating at 3.8 cluster version. The new member sets 3.8 as its cluster version and starts operating normally. At this point all members of the cluster have been upgraded to codebase version 3.9.0 but the cluster still operates at cluster version 3.8. In order to use 3.9 features the cluster version must be changed to 3.9. There are two ways to accomplish this: Use Management Center. Use the command line cluster.sh script. Network Partitions and Rolling Upgrades In the event of network partitions which split your cluster into two subclusters, split brain handling works as explained in the Network Partitioning section, with the additional constraint that two subclusters will only merge as long as they operate on the same cluster version. This is a requirement to ensure that all members participating in each one of the subclusters will be able to operate as members of the merged cluster at the same cluster version. With regards to rolling upgrades, the above constraint implies that if a network partition occurs while a change of cluster version is in progress, then with some unlucky timing, one subcluster may be upgraded to the new cluster version and another subcluster may have upgraded members but still operate at the old cluster version. In order for the two subclusters to merge, it is necessary to change the cluster version of the subcluster that still operates at the old cluster version, so that both subclusters will be operating at the same, upgraded cluster version and will be able to merge as soon as the network partition is fixed. Rolling Upgrade FAQ How is the cluster version set? When a new member starts, it is not yet joined to a cluster; therefore its cluster version is still undetermined. In order for the cluster version to be set, one of the following must happen: the member cannot locate any members of the cluster to join or is configured without a joiner: in this case, the member will appoint itself as the master of a new single-member cluster and its cluster version will be set to the major.minor version of its own codebase version. So a standalone member running on codebase version 3.8.0 will set its own cluster version to 3.8. the member that is starting locates members of the cluster and identifies which is the master: in this case, the master will validate that the joining member's codebase version is compatible with the current cluster version. If it is found to be compatible, then the member joins and the master sends the cluster version, which is set on the joining member. Otherwise, the starting member fails to join and shuts down. What if a new Hazelcast minor version changes fundamental cluster protocol communication, like join messages? NOTE: The version numbers used in the paragraph below are only used as an example. On startup, as explained above, the cluster version is not yet known to a member that has not joined any cluster. By default the newly started member will use the cluster protocol that corresponds to its codebase version until this member joins a cluster (so for codebase 3.9.0 this means implicitly assuming cluster version 3.9). If, hypothetically, major changes in discovery &amp; join operations have been introduced which do not allow the member to join a 3.8 cluster, then the member should be explicitly configured to start assuming a 3.8 cluster version. Do I have to upgrade clients to work with rolling upgrades? Starting with Hazelcast version 3.6, the Hazelcast Open Binary Client Protocol was introduced. Clients which implement the Open Binary Client Protocol are compatible with Hazelcast version 3.6 and newer minor versions. Thus older client versions will be compatible with next minor versions. Newer clients connected to a cluster will operate at the lower version of capabilities until all members are upgraded and the cluster version upgrade occurs. Can I stop and start multiple members at once during a rolling member upgrade? It is not recommended due to potential network partitions. It is advised to always stop and start one member in each upgrade step. Can I upgrade my business app together with Hazelcast while doing a rolling member upgrade? Yes, but make sure to make the new version of your app compatible with the old one since there will be a timespan when both versions interoperate. Checking if two versions of your app are compatible includes verifying binary and algorithmic compatibility, and some other steps. It is worth mentioning that a business app upgrade is orthogonal to a rolling member upgrade. A rolling business app upgrade may be done without upgrading the members.","tags":"","url":"Rolling_Member_Upgrades.html"},{"title":"Distributed Data Structures","text":"As mentioned in the Overview section, Hazelcast offers distributed implementations of Java interfaces. Below is the list of these implementations with links to the corresponding sections in this manual. Standard utility collections Map is the distributed implementation of java.util.Map. It lets you read from and write to a Hazelcast map with methods such as get and put. Queue is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue. You can add an item in one member and remove it from another one. Ringbuffer is implemented for reliable eventing system. It is also a distributed data structure. Set is the distributed and concurrent implementation of java.util.Set. It does not allow duplicate elements and does not preserve their order. List is similar to Hazelcast Set. The only difference is that it allows duplicate elements and preserves their order. MultiMap is a specialized Hazelcast map. It is a distributed data structure where you can store multiple values for a single key. Replicated Map does not partition data. It does not spread data to different cluster members. Instead, it replicates the data to all members. Cardinality Estimator is a data structure which implements Flajolet's HyperLogLog algorithm. Topic is the distributed mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers. It is also known as the publish\/subscribe (pub\/sub) messaging model. Please see the Topic section for more information. Hazelcast also has a structure called Reliable Topic which uses the same interface of Hazelcast Topic. The difference is that it is backed up by the Ringbuffer data structure. Please see the Reliable Topic section. Concurrency utilities Lock is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock. When you use lock, the critical section that Hazelcast Lock guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster. Semaphore is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.Semaphore. When performing concurrent activities, semaphores offer permits to control the thread counts. AtomicLong is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong. Most of AtomicLong's operations are available. However, these operations involve remote calls and hence their performances differ from AtomicLong, due to being distributed. AtomicReference is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference. When you need to deal with a reference in a distributed environment, you can use Hazelcast AtomicReference. IdGenerator is used to generate cluster-wide unique identifiers. ID generation occurs almost at the speed of AtomicLong.incrementAndGet(). CountdownLatch is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch. Hazelcast CountDownLatch is a gate keeper for concurrent activities. It enables the threads to wait for other threads to complete their operations. Overview of Hazelcast Distributed Objects Hazelcast has two types of distributed objects in terms of their partitioning strategies: Data structures where each partition stores a part of the instance, namely partitioned data structures. Data structures where a single partition stores the whole instance, namely non-partitioned data structures. Partitioned Hazelcast data structures are: Map MultiMap Cache (Hazelcast JCache implementation) Non-partitioned Hazelcast data structures are: Queue Set List Ringbuffer Lock Semaphore AtomicLong AtomicReference IdGenerator CountdownLatch Cardinality Estimator Besides these, Hazelcast also offers the Replicated Map structure as explained in the above Standard utility collections list. Loading and Destroying a Distributed Object Hazelcast offers a get method for most of its distributed objects. To load an object, first create a Hazelcast instance and then use the related get method on this instance. Following example code snippet creates an Hazelcast instance and a map on this instance. public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); As to the configuration of distributed object, Hazelcast uses the default settings from the file hazelcast.xml that comes with your Hazelcast download. Of course, you can provide an explicit configuration in this XML or programmatically according to your needs. Please see the Understanding Configuration section. Note that, most of Hazelcast's distributed objects are created lazily, i.e., a distributed object is created once the first operation accesses it. If you want to use an object you loaded in other places, you can safely reload it using its reference without creating a new Hazelcast instance (customers in the above example). To destroy a Hazelcast distributed object, you can use the method destroy. This method clears and releases all resources of the object. Therefore, you must use it with care since a reload with the same object reference after the object is destroyed creates a new data structure without an error. Please see the following example code where one of the queues are destroyed and the other one is accessed. public class Member { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance hz1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); HazelcastInstance hz2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IQueue&lt;String&gt; q1 = hz1.getQueue(&quot;q&quot;); IQueue&lt;String&gt; q2 = hz2.getQueue(&quot;q&quot;); q1.add(&quot;foo&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;q1.size: &quot;+q1.size()+ &quot; q2.size:&quot;+q2.size()); q1.destroy(); System.out.println(&quot;q1.size: &quot;+q1.size() + &quot; q2.size:&quot;+q2.size()); } } If you start the Member above, the output will be as shown below: q1.size: 1 q2.size:1 q1.size: 0 q2.size:0 As you see, no error is generated and a new queue resource is created. Controlling Partitions Hazelcast uses the name of a distributed object to determine which partition it will be put. Let's load two semaphores as shown below: public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); ISemaphore s1 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore(&quot;s1&quot;); ISemaphore s2 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore(&quot;s2&quot;); Since these semaphores have different names, they will be placed into different partitions. If you want to put these two into the same partition, you use the @ symbol as shown below: public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); ISemaphore s1 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore(&quot;s1@foo&quot;); ISemaphore s2 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore(&quot;s2@foo&quot;); Now, these two semaphores will be put into the same partition whose partition key is foo. Note that you can use the method getPartitionKey to learn the partition key of a distributed object. It may be useful when you want to create an object in the same partition of an existing object. Please see its usage as shown below: String partitionKey = s1.getPartitionKey(); ISemaphore s3 = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore(&quot;s3@&quot;+partitionKey); Common Features of all Hazelcast Data Structures If a member goes down, its backup replica (which holds the same data) will dynamically redistribute the data, including the ownership and locks on them, to the remaining live members. As a result, there will not be any data loss. There is no single cluster master that can be a single point of failure. Every member in the cluster has equal rights and responsibilities. No single member is superior. There is no dependency on an external 'server' or 'master'. Example Distributed Object Code Here is an example of how you can retrieve existing data structure instances (map, queue, set, lock, topic, etc.) and how you can listen for instance events, such as an instance being created or destroyed. import java.util.Collection; import com.hazelcast.config.Config; import com.hazelcast.core.*; public class Sample implements DistributedObjectListener { public static void main(String[] args) { Sample sample = new Sample(); Config config = new Config(); HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); hazelcastInstance.addDistributedObjectListener(sample); Collection&lt;DistributedObject&gt; distributedObjects = hazelcastInstance.getDistributedObjects(); for (DistributedObject distributedObject : distributedObjects) { System.out.println(distributedObject.getName() + &quot;,&quot; + distributedObject.getId()); } } @Override public void distributedObjectCreated(DistributedObjectEvent event) { DistributedObject instance = event.getDistributedObject(); System.out.println(&quot;Created &quot; + instance.getName() + &quot;,&quot; + instance.getId()); } @Override public void distributedObjectDestroyed(DistributedObjectEvent event) { DistributedObject instance = event.getDistributedObject(); System.out.println(&quot;Destroyed &quot; + instance.getName() + &quot;,&quot; + instance.getId()); } }","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/index.html"},{"title":"Getting Map and Putting Entries","text":"Hazelcast Map (IMap) extends the interface java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap and hence java.util.Map. It is the distributed implementation of Java map. You can perform operations like reading and writing from\/to a Hazelcast map with the well known get and put methods. Getting a Map and Putting an Entry Hazelcast will partition your map entries and almost evenly distribute them onto all Hazelcast members. Each member carries approximately &quot;(1\/n * total-data) + backups&quot;, n being the number of members in the cluster. For example, if you have a member with 1000 objects to be stored in the cluster, and then you start a second member, each member will both store 500 objects and back up the 500 objects in the other member. Let's create a Hazelcast instance and fill a map named Capitals with key-value pairs using the following code. Use the HazelcastInstance getMap method to get the map, then use the map put method to put an entry into the map. public class FillMapMember { public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hzInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map&lt;String, String&gt; capitalcities = hzInstance.getMap( &quot;capitals&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;1&quot;, &quot;Tokyo&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;2&quot;, &quot;Paris\u00e2\u0080\u009d ); capitalcities.put( &quot;3&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;4&quot;, &quot;Ankara&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;5&quot;, &quot;Brussels&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;6&quot;, &quot;Amsterdam&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;7&quot;, &quot;New Delhi&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;8&quot;, &quot;London&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;9&quot;, &quot;Berlin&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;10&quot;, &quot;Oslo&quot; ); capitalcities.put( &quot;11&quot;, &quot;Moscow&quot; ); ... ... capitalcities.put( &quot;120&quot;, &quot;Stockholm&quot; ) } } When you run this code, a cluster member is created with a map whose entries are distributed across the members' partitions. See the below illustration. For now, this is a single member cluster. NOTE: Please note that some of the partitions will not contain any data entries since we only have 120 objects and the partition count is 271 by default. This count is configurable and can be changed using the system property hazelcast.partition.count. Please see the System Properties section. Creating A Member for Map Backup Now let's create a second member by running the above code again. This will create a cluster with two members. This is also where backups of entries are created--remember the backup partitions mentioned in the Hazelcast Overview section. The following illustration shows two members and how the data and its backup is distributed. As you see, when a new member joins the cluster, it takes ownership and loads some of the data in the cluster. Eventually, it will carry almost &quot;(1\/n * total-data) + backups&quot; of the data, reducing the load on other members. HazelcastInstance::getMap returns an instance of com.hazelcast.core.IMap which extends the java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap interface. Methods like ConcurrentMap.putIfAbsent(key,value) and ConcurrentMap.replace(key,value) can be used on the distributed map, as shown in the example below. import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap; HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Customer getCustomer( String id ) { ConcurrentMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); Customer customer = customers.get( id ); if (customer == null) { customer = new Customer( id ); customer = customers.putIfAbsent( id, customer ); } return customer; } public boolean updateCustomer( Customer customer ) { ConcurrentMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); return ( customers.replace( customer.getId(), customer ) != null ); } public boolean removeCustomer( Customer customer ) { ConcurrentMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); return customers.remove( customer.getId(), customer ); } All ConcurrentMap operations such as put and remove might wait if the key is locked by another thread in the local or remote JVM. But, they will eventually return with success. ConcurrentMap operations never throw a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException. Also see: Data Affinity section. Map Configuration with wildcards.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Map\/Getting_Map_and_Putting_Entries.html"},{"title":"Backing Up Maps","text":"Hazelcast distributes map entries onto multiple cluster members (JVMs). Each member holds some portion of the data. Distributed maps have one backup by default. If a member goes down, you do not lose data. Backup operations are synchronous, so when a map.put(key, value) returns, it is guaranteed that the map entry is replicated to one other member. For the reads, it is also guaranteed that map.get(key) returns the latest value of the entry. Consistency is strictly enforced. Creating Sync Backups To provide data safety, Hazelcast allows you to specify the number of backup copies you want to have. That way, data on a cluster member will be copied onto other member(s). To create synchronous backups, select the number of backup copies using the backup-count property. &lt;hazelcast&gt; &lt;map name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; &lt;backup-count&gt;1&lt;\/backup-count&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; When this count is 1, a map entry will have its backup on one other member in the cluster. If you set it to 2, then a map entry will have its backup on two other members. You can set it to 0 if you do not want your entries to be backed up, e.g., if performance is more important than backing up. The maximum value for the backup count is 6. Hazelcast supports both synchronous and asynchronous backups. By default, backup operations are synchronous and configured with backup-count. In this case, backup operations block operations until backups are successfully copied to backup members (or deleted from backup members in case of remove) and acknowledgements are received. Therefore, backups are updated before a put operation is completed, provided that the cluster is stable. Sync backup operations have a blocking cost which may lead to latency issues. Creating Async Backups Asynchronous backups, on the other hand, do not block operations. They are fire &amp; forget and do not require acknowledgements; the backup operations are performed at some point in time. To create asynchronous backups, select the number of async backups with the async-backup-count property. An example is shown below. &lt;hazelcast&gt; &lt;map name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; &lt;backup-count&gt;0&lt;\/backup-count&gt; &lt;async-backup-count&gt;1&lt;\/async-backup-count&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; NOTE: Backups increase memory usage since they are also kept in memory. NOTE: A map can have both sync and aysnc backups at the same time. Enabling Backup Reads By default, Hazelcast has one sync backup copy. If backup-count is set to more than 1, then each member will carry both owned entries and backup copies of other members. So for the map.get(key) call, it is possible that the calling member has a backup copy of that key. By default, map.get(key) will always read the value from the actual owner of the key for consistency. To enable backup reads (read local backup entries), set the value of the read-backup-data property to true. Its default value is false for strong consistency. Enabling backup reads can improve performance. &lt;hazelcast&gt; &lt;map name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; &lt;backup-count&gt;0&lt;\/backup-count&gt; &lt;async-backup-count&gt;1&lt;\/async-backup-count&gt; &lt;read-backup-data&gt;true&lt;\/read-backup-data&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; This feature is available when there is at least one sync or async backup. Please note that if you are performing a read from a backup, you should take into account that your hits to the keys in the backups are not reflected as hits to the original keys on the primary members. This has an impact on IMap's maximum idle seconds or time-to-live seconds expiration. Therefore, even though there is a hit on a key in backups, your original key on the primary member may expire.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Map\/Backing_Up_Maps.html"},{"title":"Map Eviction","text":"NOTE: Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, Hazelcast Map uses a new eviction mechanism which is based on the sampling of entries. Please see the Eviction Algorithm section for details. Evicting Map Entries Unless you delete the map entries manually or use an eviction policy, they will remain in the map. Hazelcast supports policy-based eviction for distributed maps. Currently supported policies are LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used). Understanding Map Eviction Hazelcast Map performs eviction based on partitions. For example, when you specify a size using the PER_NODE attribute for max-size (please see Configuring Map Eviction), Hazelcast internally calculates the maximum size for every partition. Hazelcast uses the following equation to calculate the maximum size of a partition: partition maximum size = max-size * member-count \/ partition-count The eviction process starts according to this calculated partition maximum size when you try to put an entry. When entry count in that partition exceeds partition maximum size, eviction starts on that partition. Assume that you have the following figures as examples: Partition count: 200 Entry count for each partition: 100 max-size (PER_NODE): 20000 The total number of entries here is 20000 (partition count * entry count for each partition). This means you are at the eviction threshold since you set the max-size to 20000. When you try to put an entry the entry goes to the relevant partition; the partition checks whether the eviction threshold is reached (max-size); only one entry will be evicted. As a result of this eviction process, when you check the size of your map, it is 19999. After this eviction, subsequent put operations will not trigger the next eviction until the map size is again close to the max-size. NOTE: The above scenario is simply an example that describes how the eviction process works. Hazelcast finds the most optimum number of entries to be evicted according to your cluster size and selected policy. Configuring Map Eviction The following is an example declarative configuration for map eviction. &lt;hazelcast&gt; &lt;map name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; ... &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;0&lt;\/time-to-live-seconds&gt; &lt;max-idle-seconds&gt;0&lt;\/max-idle-seconds&gt; &lt;eviction-policy&gt;LRU&lt;\/eviction-policy&gt; &lt;max-size policy=&quot;PER_NODE&quot;&gt;5000&lt;\/max-size&gt; ... &lt;\/map&gt; &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; Let's describe each element: time-to-live. Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay in the map. If it is not 0, entries that are older than this time and not updated for this time are evicted automatically. Valid values are integers between 0 and Integer.MAX VALUE. Default value is 0, which means infinite. If it is not 0, entries are evicted regardless of the set eviction-policy. max-idle-seconds. Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay idle in the map. Entries that are idle for more than this time are evicted automatically. An entry is idle if no get, put, EntryProcessor.process or containsKey is called. Valid values are integers between 0 and Integer.MAX VALUE. Default value is 0, which means infinite. eviction-policy. Valid values are described below. NONE: Default policy. If set, no items will be evicted and the property max-size will be ignored. You still can combine it with time-to-live-seconds and max-idle-seconds. LRU: Least Recently Used. LFU: Least Frequently Used. max-size. Maximum size of the map. When maximum size is reached, the map is evicted based on the policy defined. Valid values are integers between 0 and Integer.MAX VALUE. Default value is 0. If you want max-size to work, set the eviction-policy property to a value other than NONE. Its attributes are described below. PER_NODE. Maximum number of map entries in each cluster member. This is the default policy. If you use this option, please note that you cannot set the max-size to a value lower than the partition count (which is 271 by default). &lt;max-size policy=&quot;PER_NODE&quot;&gt;5000&lt;\/max-size&gt; PER_PARTITION. Maximum number of map entries within each partition. Storage size depends on the partition count in a cluster member. This attribute should not be used often. For instance, avoid using this attribute with a small cluster. If the cluster is small, it will be hosting more partitions, and therefore map entries, than that of a larger cluster. Thus, for a small cluster, eviction of the entries will decrease performance (the number of entries is large). &lt;max-size policy=&quot;PER_PARTITION&quot;&gt;27100&lt;\/max-size&gt; USED_HEAP_SIZE. Maximum used heap size in megabytes per map for each Hazelcast instance. Please note that this policy does not work when in-memory format is set to OBJECT, since the memory footprint cannot be determined when data is put as OBJECT. &lt;max-size policy=&quot;USED_HEAP_SIZE&quot;&gt;4096&lt;\/max-size&gt; USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE. Maximum used heap size percentage per map for each Hazelcast instance. If, for example, a JVM is configured to have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries will be evicted when used heap size exceeds 100 MB. Please note that this policy does not work when in-memory format is set to OBJECT, since the memory footprint cannot be determined when data is put as OBJECT. &lt;max-size policy=&quot;USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE&quot;&gt;10&lt;\/max-size&gt; FREE_HEAP_SIZE. Minimum free heap size in megabytes for each JVM. &lt;max-size policy=&quot;FREE_HEAP_SIZE&quot;&gt;512&lt;\/max-size&gt; FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE. Minimum free heap size percentage for each JVM. If, for example, a JVM is configured to have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries will be evicted when free heap size is below 100 MB. &lt;max-size policy=&quot;FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE&quot;&gt;10&lt;\/max-size&gt; USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE. (Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD) Maximum used native memory size in megabytes per map for each Hazelcast instance. &lt;max-size policy=&quot;USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE&quot;&gt;1024&lt;\/max-size&gt; USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE. (Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD) Maximum used native memory size percentage per map for each Hazelcast instance. &lt;max-size policy=&quot;USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE&quot;&gt;65&lt;\/max-size&gt; FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE. (Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD) Minimum free native memory size in megabytes for each Hazelcast instance. &lt;max-size policy=&quot;FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE&quot;&gt;256&lt;\/max-size&gt; FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE. (Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD) Minimum free native memory size percentage for each Hazelcast instance. &lt;max-size policy=&quot;FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE&quot;&gt;5&lt;\/max-size&gt; NOTE: As of Hazelcast 3.7, the elements eviction-percentage and min-eviction-check-millis are deprecated. They will be ignored if configured since map eviction is based on the sampling of entries. Please see the Eviction Algorithm section for details. Example Eviction Configurations &lt;map name=&quot;documents&quot;&gt; &lt;max-size policy=&quot;PER_NODE&quot;&gt;10000&lt;\/max-size&gt; &lt;eviction-policy&gt;LRU&lt;\/eviction-policy&gt; &lt;max-idle-seconds&gt;60&lt;\/max-idle-seconds&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; In the above example, documents map starts to evict its entries from a member when the map size exceeds 10000 in that member. Then the entries least recently used will be evicted. The entries not used for more than 60 seconds will be evicted as well. And the following is an example eviction configuration for a map having NATIVE as the in-memory format: &lt;map name=&quot;nativeMap*&quot;&gt; &lt;in-memory-format&gt;NATIVE&lt;\/in-memory-format&gt; &lt;eviction-policy&gt;LFU&lt;\/eviction-policy&gt; &lt;max-size policy=&quot;USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE&quot;&gt;99&lt;\/max-size&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; Evicting Specific Entries The eviction policies and configurations explained above apply to all the entries of a map. The entries that meet the specified eviction conditions are evicted. You may also want to evict some specific map entries. To do this, you can use the ttl and timeunit parameters of the method map.put(). An example code line is given below. myMap.put( &quot;1&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, 50, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) The map entry with the key &quot;1&quot; will be evicted 50 seconds after it is put into myMap. Evicting All Entries To evict all keys from the map except the locked ones, use the method evictAll(). If a MapStore is defined for the map, deleteAll is not called by evictAll. If you want to call the method deleteAll, use clear(). An example is given below. public class EvictAll { public static void main(String[] args) { final int numberOfKeysToLock = 4; final int numberOfEntriesToAdd = 1000; HazelcastInstance node1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); HazelcastInstance node2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = node1.getMap(EvictAll.class.getCanonicalName()); for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfEntriesToAdd; i++) { map.put(i, i); } for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfKeysToLock; i++) { map.lock(i); } \/\/ should keep locked keys and evict all others. map.evictAll(); System.out.printf(&quot;# After calling evictAll...\\n&quot;); System.out.printf(&quot;# Expected map size\\t: %d\\n&quot;, numberOfKeysToLock); System.out.printf(&quot;# Actual map size\\t: %d\\n&quot;, map.size()); } } NOTE: Only EVICT_ALL event is fired for any registered listeners. Forced Eviction Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Hazelcast may use forced eviction in the cases when the eviction explained in Understanding Map Eviction is not enough to free up your memory. Note that this is valid if you are using Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise and you set your in-memory format to NATIVE. Forced eviction mechanism is explained below as steps in the given order: When the normal eviction is not enough, forced eviction is triggered and first it tries to evict approx. 20% of the entries from the current partition. It retries this five times. If the result of above step is still not enough, forced eviction applies the above step to all maps. This time it might perform eviction from some other partitions too,provided that they are owned by the same thread. If that is still not enough to free up your memory, it evicts not the 20% but all the entries from the current partition. if that is not enough, it will evict all the entries from the other data structures; from the partitions owned by the local thread. Finally, when all the above steps are not enough, Hazelcast throws a Native Out of Memory Exception. Custom Eviction Policy NOTE: This section is valid for Hazelcast 3.7 and higher releases. Apart from the policies such as LRU and LFU, which Hazelcast provides out of the box, you can develop and use your own eviction policy. To achieve this, you need to provide an implementation of MapEvictionPolicy as in the following OddEvictor example: public class MapCustomEvictionPolicy { public static void main(String[] args) { Config config = new Config(); config.getMapConfig(&quot;test&quot;) .setMapEvictionPolicy(new OddEvictor()) .getMaxSizeConfig() .setMaxSizePolicy(PER_NODE).setSize(10000); HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); IMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = instance.getMap(&quot;test&quot;); final Queue&lt;Integer&gt; oddKeys = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Integer&gt;(); final Queue&lt;Integer&gt; evenKeys = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Integer&gt;(); map.addEntryListener(new EntryEvictedListener&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;() { @Override public void entryEvicted(EntryEvent&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; event) { Integer key = event.getKey(); if (key % 2 == 0) { evenKeys.add(key); } else { oddKeys.add(key); } } }, false); \/\/ Wait some more time to receive evicted events. parkNanos(SECONDS.toNanos(5)); for (int i = 0; i &lt; 15000; i++) { map.put(i, i); } String msg = &quot;IMap uses sampling based eviction. After eviction is completed, we are expecting &quot; + &quot;number of evicted-odd-keys should be greater than number of evicted-even-keys&quot; + &quot;\\nNumber of evicted-odd-keys = %d, number of evicted-even-keys = %d&quot;; out.println(format(msg, oddKeys.size(), evenKeys.size())); instance.shutdown(); } \/** * Odd evictor tries to evict odd keys first. *\/ private static class OddEvictor extends MapEvictionPolicy { @Override public int compare(EntryView o1, EntryView o2) { Integer key = (Integer) o1.getKey(); if (key % 2 != 0) { return -1; } return 1; } } } Then you can enable your policy by setting it via the method MapConfig#setMapEvictionPolicy programmatically or via XML declaratively. Following is the example declarative configuration for the eviction policy OddEvictor implemented above: &lt;map name=&quot;test&quot;&gt; ... &lt;map-eviction-policy-class-name&gt;com.package.OddEvictor&lt;\/map-eviction-policy-class-name&gt; .... &lt;\/map&gt; If you Hazelcast with Spring, you can enable your policy as shown below. &lt;hz:map name=&quot;test&quot;&gt; &lt;hz:map-eviction-policy class-name=&quot;com.package.OddEvictor&quot;\/&gt; &lt;\/hz:map&gt;","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Map\/Map_Eviction.html"},{"title":"Setting In Memory Format","text":"IMap (and a few other Hazelcast data structures, such as ICache) has an in-memory-format configuration option. By default, Hazelcast stores data into memory in binary (serialized) format. Sometimes it can be efficient to store the entries in their object form, especially in cases of local processing, such as entry processor and queries. To set how the data will be stored in memory, set in-memory-format in the configuration. You have the following format options: BINARY (default). The data (both the key and value) will be stored in serialized binary format. You can use this option if you mostly perform regular map operations, such as put and get. OBJECT. The data will be stored in deserialized form. This configuration is good for maps where entry processing and queries form the majority of all operations and the objects are complex, making the serialization cost comparatively high. By storing objects, entry processing will not contain the deserialization cost. Note that when you use OBJECT as the in-memory format, the key will still be stored in binary format, and the value will be stored in object format. NATIVE: (Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD) This format behaves the same as BINARY, however, instead of heap memory, key and value will be stored in the off-heap memory. Regular operations like get rely on the object instance. When the OBJECT format is used and a get is performed, the map does not return the stored instance, but creates a clone. Therefore, this whole get operation first includes a serialization on the member owning the instance, and then a deserialization on the member calling the instance. When the BINARY format is used, only a deserialization is required; BINARY is faster. Similarly, a put operation is faster when the BINARY format is used. If the format was OBJECT, the map would create a clone of the instance, and there would first be a serialization and then a deserialization. When BINARY is used, only a deserialization is needed. NOTE: If a value is stored in OBJECT format, a change on a returned value does not affect the stored instance. In this case, the returned instance is not the actual one but a clone. Therefore, changes made on an object after it is returned will not reflect on the actual stored data. Similarly, when a value is written to a map and the value is stored in OBJECT format, it will be a copy of the put value. Therefore, changes made on the object after it is stored will not reflect on the stored data.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Map\/Setting_In_Memory_Format.html"},{"title":"Using High-Density Memory Store with Map","text":"Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD Hazelcast instances are Java programs. In case of BINARY and OBJECT in-memory formats, Hazelcast stores your distributed data into the heap of its server instances. Java heap is subject to garbage collection (GC). In case of larger heaps, garbage collection might cause your application to pause for tens of seconds (even minutes for really large heaps), badly affecting your application performance and response times. As the data gets bigger, you either run the application with larger heap, which would result in longer GC pauses or run multiple instances with smaller heap which can turn into an operational nightmare if the number of such instances becomes very high. To overcome this challenge, Hazelcast offers High-Density Memory Store for your maps. You can configure your map to use High-Density Memory Store by setting the in-memory format to NATIVE. The following snippet is the declarative configuration example. &lt;map name=&quot;nativeMap*&quot;&gt; &lt;in-memory-format&gt;NATIVE&lt;\/in-memory-format&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; Keep in mind that you should have already enabled the High-Density Memory Store usage for your cluster. Please see Configuring High-Density Memory Store section. Required configuration changes when using NATIVE Note that the eviction mechanism is different for NATIVE in-memory format. The new eviction algorithm for map with High-Density Memory Store is similar to that of JCache with High-Density Memory Store and is described here. Eviction percentage has no effect. &lt;map name=&quot;nativeMap*&quot;&gt; &lt;in-memory-format&gt;NATIVE&lt;\/in-memory-format&gt; &lt;eviction-percentage&gt;25&lt;\/eviction-percentage&gt; &lt;-- NO IMPACT with NATIVE &lt;\/map&gt; These IMap eviction policies for max-size cannot be used: FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE, FREE_HEAP_SIZE, USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE, USED_HEAP_SIZE.

To do this, you can use Hazelcast's MapStore and MapLoader interfaces. When you provide a MapLoader implementation and request an entry (IMap.get()) that does not exist in memory, MapLoader's load or loadAll methods will load that entry from the data store. This loaded entry is placed into the map and will stay there until it is removed or evicted. When a MapStore implementation is provided, an entry is also put into a user defined data store. NOTE: Data store needs to be a centralized system that is accessible from all Hazelcast members. Persistence to a local file system is not supported. NOTE: Also note that the MapStore interface extends the MapLoader interface as you can see in the interface code. Following is a MapStore example. public class PersonMapStore implements MapStore&lt;Long, Person&gt; { private final Connection con; public PersonMapStore() { try { con = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:hsqldb:mydatabase&quot;, &quot;SA&quot;, &quot;&quot;); con.createStatement().executeUpdate( &quot;create table if not exists person (id bigint, name varchar(45))&quot;); } catch (SQLException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } } public synchronized void delete(Long key) { System.out.println(&quot;Delete:&quot; + key); try { con.createStatement().executeUpdate( format(&quot;delete from person where id = %s&quot;, key)); } catch (SQLException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } } public synchronized void store(Long key, Person value) { try { con.createStatement().executeUpdate( format(&quot;insert into person values(%s,'%s')&quot;, key, value.name)); } catch (SQLException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } } public synchronized void storeAll(Map&lt;Long, Person&gt; map) { for (Map.Entry&lt;Long, Person&gt; entry : map.entrySet()) store(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()); } public synchronized void deleteAll(Collection&lt;Long&gt; keys) { for (Long key : keys) delete(key); } public synchronized Person load(Long key) { try { ResultSet resultSet = con.createStatement().executeQuery( format(&quot;select name from person where id =%s&quot;, key)); try { if (!resultSet.next()) return null; String name = resultSet.getString(1); return new Person(name); } finally { resultSet.close(); } } catch (SQLException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); } } public synchronized Map&lt;Long, Person&gt; loadAll(Collection&lt;Long&gt; keys) { Map&lt;Long, Person&gt; result = new HashMap&lt;Long, Person&gt;(); for (Long key : keys) result.put(key, load(key)); return result; } public Iterable&lt;Long&gt; loadAllKeys() { return null; } } NOTE: During the initial loading process, MapStore uses a thread different from the partition threads that are used by the ExecutorService. After the initialization is completed, the map.get method looks up any nonexistent value from the database in a partition thread, or the map.put method looks up the database to return the previously associated value for a key also in a partition thread. RELATED INFORMATION For more MapStore\/MapLoader code samples, please see here. Hazelcast supports read-through, write-through, and write-behind persistence modes, which are explained in the subsections below. Using Read-Through Persistence If an entry does not exist in memory when an application asks for it, Hazelcast asks the loader implementation to load that entry from the data store. If the entry exists there, the loader implementation gets it, hands it to Hazelcast, and Hazelcast puts it into memory. This is read-through persistence mode. Setting Write-Through Persistence MapStore can be configured to be write-through by setting the write-delay-seconds property to 0. This means the entries will be put to the data store synchronously. In this mode, when the map.put(key,value) call returns: MapStore.store(key,value) is successfully called so the entry is persisted. In-Memory entry is updated. In-Memory backup copies are successfully created on other cluster members (if backup-count is greater than 0). The same behavior goes for a map.remove(key) call. The only difference is that MapStore.delete(key) is called when the entry will be deleted. If MapStore throws an exception, then the exception will be propagated back to the original put or remove call in the form of RuntimeException. Setting Write-Behind Persistence You can configure MapStore as write-behind by setting the write-delay-seconds property to a value bigger than 0. This means the modified entries will be put to the data store asynchronously after a configured delay. NOTE: In write-behind mode, Hazelcast coalesces updates on a specific key by default, which means it applies only the last update on that key. However, you can set MapStoreConfig#setWriteCoalescing to FALSE and you can store all updates performed on a key to the data store. NOTE: When you set MapStoreConfig#setWriteCoalescing to FALSE, after you reached per-node maximum write-behind-queue capacity, subsequent put operations will fail with ReachedMaxSizeException. This exception will be thrown to prevent uncontrolled grow of write-behind queues. You can set per-node maximum capacity using the system property hazelcast.map.write.behind.queue.capacity. Please refer to the System Properties section for information on this property and how to set the system properties. In write-behind mode, when the map.put(key,value) call returns: In-Memory entry is updated. In-Memory backup copies are successfully created on other cluster members (if backup-count is greater than 0). The entry is marked as dirty so that after write-delay-seconds, it can be persisted with MapStore.store(key,value) call. For fault tolerance, dirty entries are stored in a queue on the primary member and also on a back-up member. The same behavior goes for the map.remove(key), the only difference is that MapStore.delete(key) is called when the entry will be deleted. If MapStore throws an exception, then Hazelcast tries to store the entry again. If the entry still cannot be stored, a log message is printed and the entry is re-queued. For batch write operations, which are only allowed in write-behind mode, Hazelcast will call MapStore.storeAll(map) and MapStore.deleteAll(collection) to do all writes in a single call. NOTE: If a map entry is marked as dirty, meaning that it is waiting to be persisted to the MapStore in a write-behind scenario, the eviction process forces the entry to be stored. This way you have control over the number of entries waiting to be stored, and thus you can prevent a possible OutOfMemory exception. NOTE: MapStore or MapLoader implementations should not use Hazelcast Map\/Queue\/MultiMap\/List\/Set operations. Your implementation should only work with your data store. Otherwise, you may get into deadlock situations. Here is a sample configuration: &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;map name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; ... &lt;map-store enabled=&quot;true&quot; initial-mode=&quot;LAZY&quot;&gt; &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.examples.DummyStore&lt;\/class-name&gt; &lt;write-delay-seconds&gt;60&lt;\/write-delay-seconds&gt; &lt;write-batch-size&gt;1000&lt;\/write-batch-size&gt; &lt;write-coalescing&gt;true&lt;\/write-coalescing&gt; &lt;\/map-store&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; The following are the descriptions of MapStore configuration elements and attributes: class-name: Name of the class implementing MapLoader and\/or MapStore. write-delay-seconds: Number of seconds to delay to call the MapStore.store(key, value). If the value is zero then it is write-through so MapStore.store(key, value) will be called as soon as the entry is updated. Otherwise it is write-behind so updates will be stored after write-delay-seconds value by calling Hazelcast.storeAll(map). Default value is 0. write-batch-size: Used to create batch chunks when writing map store. In default mode, all map entries will be tried to be written in one go. To create batch chunks, the minimum meaningful value for write-batch-size is 2. For values smaller than 2, it works as in default mode. write-coalescing: In write-behind mode, Hazelcast coalesces updates on a specific key by default; it applies only the last update on it. You can set this element to false to store all updates performed on a key to the data store. enabled: True to enable this map-store, false to disable. Default value is true. initial-mode: Sets the initial load mode. LAZY is the default load mode, where load is asynchronous. EAGER means load is blocked till all partitions are loaded. Storing Entries to Multiple Maps A configuration can be applied to more than one map using wildcards (see Using Wildcards), meaning that the configuration is shared among the maps. But MapStore does not know which entries to store when there is one configuration applied to multiple maps. To store entries when there is one configuration applied to multiple maps, use Hazelcast's MapStoreFactory interface. Using the MapStoreFactory interface, MapStores for each map can be created when a wildcard configuration is used. Example code is shown below. Config config = new Config(); MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig( &quot;*&quot; ); MapStoreConfig mapStoreConfig = mapConfig.getMapStoreConfig(); mapStoreConfig.setFactoryImplementation( new MapStoreFactory&lt;Object, Object&gt;() { @Override public MapLoader&lt;Object, Object&gt; newMapStore( String mapName, Properties properties ) { return null; } }); To initialize the MapLoader implementation with the given map name, configuration properties, and the Hazelcast instance, implement the MapLoaderLifecycleSupport interface. This interface has the methods init() and destroy() as shown below. public interface MapLoaderLifecycleSupport { void init( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance, Properties properties, String mapName ); void destroy(); } The method init() initializes the MapLoader implementation. Hazelcast calls this method when the map is first used on the Hazelcast instance. The MapLoader implementation can initialize the required resources for implementing MapLoader such as reading a configuration file or creating a database connection. Hazelcast calls the method destroy() before shutting down. You can override this method to cleanup the resources held by this MapLoader implementation, such as closing the database connections. Initializing Map on Startup To pre-populate the in-memory map when the map is first touched\/used, use the MapLoader.loadAllKeys API. If MapLoader.loadAllKeys returns NULL, then nothing will be loaded. Your MapLoader.loadAllKeys implementation can return all or some of the keys. For example, you may select and return only the hot keys. MapLoader.loadAllKeys is the fastest way of pre-populating the map since Hazelcast will optimize the loading process by having each cluster member load its owned portion of the entries. The InitialLoadMode configuration parameter in the class MapStoreConfig has two values: LAZY and EAGER. If InitialLoadMode is set to LAZY, data is not loaded during the map creation. If it is set to EAGER, all the data is loaded while the map is created, and everything becomes ready to use. Also, if you add indices to your map with the MapIndexConfig class or the addIndex method, then InitialLoadMode is overridden and MapStoreConfig behaves as if EAGER mode is on. Here is the MapLoader initialization flow: When getMap() is first called from any member, initialization will start depending on the value of InitialLoadMode. If it is set to EAGER, initialization starts. If it is set to LAZY, initialization does not start but data is loaded each time a partition loading completes. Hazelcast will call MapLoader.loadAllKeys() to get all your keys on one of the members. That member will distribute keys to all other members in batches. Each member will load values of all its owned keys by calling MapLoader.loadAll(keys). Each member puts its owned entries into the map by calling IMap.putTransient(key,value). NOTE: If the load mode is LAZY and the clear() method is called (which triggers MapStore.deleteAll()), Hazelcast will remove ONLY the loaded entries from your map and datastore. Since all the data is not loaded in this case (LAZY mode), please note that there may still be entries in your datastore. NOTE: The return type of loadAllKeys() is changed from Set to Iterable with the release of Hazelcast 3.5. MapLoader implementations from previous releases are also supported and do not need to be adapted. Loading Keys Incrementally If the number of keys to load is large, it is more efficient to load them incrementally rather than loading them all at once. To support incremental loading, the MapLoader.loadAllKeys() method returns an Iterable which can be lazily populated with the results of a database query. Hazelcast iterates over the Iterable and, while doing so, sends out the keys to their respective owner members. The Iterator obtained from MapLoader.loadAllKeys() may also implement the Closeable interface, in which case Iterator is closed once the iteration is over. This is intended for releasing resources such as closing a JDBC result set. Forcing All Keys To Be Loaded The method loadAll loads some or all keys into a data store in order to optimize the multiple load operations. The method has two signatures; the same method can take two different parameter lists. One signature loads the given keys and the other loads all keys. Please see the example code below. public class LoadAll { public static void main(String[] args) { final int numberOfEntriesToAdd = 1000; final String mapName = LoadAll.class.getCanonicalName(); final Config config = createNewConfig(mapName); final HazelcastInstance node = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); final IMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = node.getMap(mapName); populateMap(map, numberOfEntriesToAdd); System.out.printf(&quot;# Map store has %d elements\\n&quot;, numberOfEntriesToAdd); map.evictAll(); System.out.printf(&quot;# After evictAll map size\\t: %d\\n&quot;, map.size()); map.loadAll(true); System.out.printf(&quot;# After loadAll map size\\t: %d\\n&quot;, map.size()); } } Post-Processing Objects in Map Store In some scenarios, you may need to modify the object after storing it into the map store. For example, you can get an ID or version auto-generated by your database and then need to modify your object stored in the distributed map, but not to break the synchronization between the database and the data grid. To post-process an object in the map store, implement the PostProcessingMapStore interface to put the modified object into the distributed map. This will trigger an extra step of Serialization, so use it only when needed. (This is only valid when using the write-through map store configuration.) Here is an example of post processing map store: class ProcessingStore implements MapStore&lt;Integer, Employee&gt;, PostProcessingMapStore { @Override public void store( Integer key, Employee employee ) { EmployeeId id = saveEmployee(); employee.setId( id.getId() ); } } NOTE: Please note that if you are using a post processing map store in combination with entry processors, post-processed values will not be carried to backups. Accessing a Database Using Properties You can prepare your own MapLoader to access a database such as Cassandra and MongDB. For this, you can first declaratively specify the database properties in your hazelcast.xml configuration file and then implement the MapLoaderLifecycleSupport interface to pass those properties. You can define the database properties, such as its URL and name, using the properties configuration element. The following is a configuration example for MongoDB: &lt;map name=&quot;supplements&quot;&gt; &lt;map-store enabled=&quot;true&quot; initial-mode=&quot;LAZY&quot;&gt; &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.loader.YourMapStoreImplementation&lt;\/class-name&gt; &lt;properties&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;mongo.url&quot;&gt;mongodb:\/\/localhost:27017&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;mongo.db&quot;&gt;mydb&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;mongo.collection&quot;&gt;supplements&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;\/properties&gt; &lt;\/map-store&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; After you specified the database properties in your configuration, you need to implement the MapLoaderLifecycleSupport interface and give those properties in the init() method, as shown below: public class YourMapStoreImplementation implements MapStore&lt;String, Supplement&gt;, MapLoaderLifecycleSupport { private MongoClient mongoClient; private MongoCollection collection; public YourMapStoreImplementation() { } @Override public void init(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance, Properties properties, String mapName) { String mongoUrl = (String) properties.get(&quot;mongo.url&quot;); String dbName = (String) properties.get(&quot;mongo.db&quot;); String collectionName = (String) properties.get(&quot;mongo.collection&quot;); this.mongoClient = new MongoClient(new MongoClientURI(mongoUrl)); this.collection = mongoClient.getDatabase(dbName).getCollection(collectionName); } You can refer to the full example here.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Map\/Loading_and_Storing_Persistent_Data.html"},{"title":"Creating Near Cache for Map","text":"The Hazelcast distributed map supports a local Near Cache for remotely stored entries to increase the performance of local read operations.

When these requirements increase or you want to have more control on the concurrency, consider the Hazelcast solutions described here. Let's work on a sample case as shown below. public class RacyUpdateMember { public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IMap&lt;String, Value&gt; map = hz.getMap( &quot;map&quot; ); String key = &quot;1&quot;; map.put( key, new Value() ); System.out.println( &quot;Starting&quot; ); for ( int k = 0; k &lt; 1000; k++ ) { if ( k % 100 == 0 ) System.out.println( &quot;At: &quot; + k ); Value value = map.get( key ); Thread.sleep( 10 ); value.amount++; map.put( key, value ); } System.out.println( &quot;Finished! Result = &quot; + map.get(key).amount ); } static class Value implements Serializable { public int amount; } } If the above code is run by more than one cluster member simultaneously, a race condition is likely. You can solve this condition with Hazelcast using either pessimistic locking or optimistic locking. Pessimistic Locking One way to solve the race issue is by using pessimistic locking--lock the map entry until you are finished with it. To perform pessimistic locking, use the lock mechanism provided by the Hazelcast distributed map, i.e., the map.lock and map.unlock methods. See the below example code. public class PessimisticUpdateMember { public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IMap&lt;String, Value&gt; map = hz.getMap( &quot;map&quot; ); String key = &quot;1&quot;; map.put( key, new Value() ); System.out.println( &quot;Starting&quot; ); for ( int k = 0; k &lt; 1000; k++ ) { map.lock( key ); try { Value value = map.get( key ); Thread.sleep( 10 ); value.amount++; map.put( key, value ); } finally { map.unlock( key ); } } System.out.println( &quot;Finished! Result = &quot; + map.get( key ).amount ); } static class Value implements Serializable { public int amount; } } The IMap lock will automatically be collected by the garbage collector when the lock is released and no other waiting conditions exist on the lock. The IMap lock is reentrant, but it does not support fairness. Another way to solve the race issue is by acquiring a predictable Lock object from Hazelcast. This way, every value in the map can be given a lock, or you can create a stripe of locks. Optimistic Locking In Hazelcast, you can apply the optimistic locking strategy with the map's replace method. This method compares values in object or data forms depending on the in-memory format configuration. If the values are equal, it replaces the old value with the new one. If you want to use your defined equals method, in-memory-format should be OBJECT. Otherwise, Hazelcast serializes objects to BINARY forms and compares them. See the below example code. public class OptimisticMember { public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IMap&lt;String, Value&gt; map = hz.getMap( &quot;map&quot; ); String key = &quot;1&quot;; map.put( key, new Value() ); System.out.println( &quot;Starting&quot; ); for ( int k = 0; k &lt; 1000; k++ ) { if ( k % 10 == 0 ) System.out.println( &quot;At: &quot; + k ); for (; ; ) { Value oldValue = map.get( key ); Value newValue = new Value( oldValue ); Thread.sleep( 10 ); newValue.amount++; if ( map.replace( key, oldValue, newValue ) ) break; } } System.out.println( &quot;Finished! Result = &quot; + map.get( key ).amount ); } static class Value implements Serializable { public int amount; public Value() { } public Value( Value that ) { this.amount = that.amount; } public boolean equals( Object o ) { if ( o == this ) return true; if ( !( o instanceof Value ) ) return false; Value that = ( Value ) o; return that.amount == this.amount; } } } NOTE: The above example code is intentionally broken. Pessimistic vs. Optimistic Locking The locking strategy you choose will depend on your locking requirements. Optimistic locking is better for mostly read-only systems. It has a performance boost over pessimistic locking. Pessimistic locking is good if there are lots of updates on the same key. It is more robust than optimistic locking from the perspective of data consistency. In Hazelcast, use IExecutorService to submit a task to a key owner, or to a member or members. This is the recommended way to perform task executions, rather than using pessimistic or optimistic locking techniques. IExecutorService will have fewer network hops and less data over wire, and tasks will be executed very near to the data. Please refer to the Data Affinity section. Solving the ABA Problem The ABA problem occurs in environments when a shared resource is open to change by multiple threads. Even if one thread sees the same value for a particular key in consecutive reads, it does not mean that nothing has changed between the reads. Another thread may change the value, do work, and change the value back, while the first thread thinks that nothing has changed. To prevent these kind of problems, you can assign a version number and check it before any write to be sure that nothing has changed between consecutive reads. Although all the other fields will be equal, the version field will prevent objects from being seen as equal. This is the optimistic locking strategy, and it is used in environments that do not expect intensive concurrent changes on a specific key. In Hazelcast, you can apply the optimistic locking strategy with the map replace method. Lock Split-Brain Protection with Pessimistic Locking Locks can be configured to check the number of currently present members before applying a locking operation. If the check fails, the lock operation will fail with a QuorumException (see Split-Brain Protection). As pessimistic locking uses lock operations internally, it will also use the configured lock quorum. This means that you can configure a lock quorum with the same name or a pattern that matches the map name. Note that the quorum for IMap locking actions can be different from the quorum for other IMap actions. The following actions will then check for lock quorum before being applied: IMap#lock(K) and IMap#lock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) IMap#isLocked IMap#tryLock(K), IMap#tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) and IMap#tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) IMap#unlock IMap#forceUnlock MultiMap#lock(K) and MultiMap#lock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) MultiMap#isLocked MultiMap#tryLock(K), MultiMap#tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) and MultiMap#tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) MultiMap#unlock MultiMap#forceUnlock An example of declarative configuration: &lt;map name=&quot;myMap&quot;&gt; &lt;quorum-ref&gt;map-actions-quorum&lt;\/quorum-ref&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; &lt;lock name=&quot;myMap&quot;&gt; &lt;quorum-ref&gt;map-lock-actions-quorum&lt;\/quorum-ref&gt; &lt;\/lock&gt; Here the configured map will use the map-lock-actions-quorum quorum for map lock actions and the map-actions-quorum quorum for other map actions.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Map\/Locking_Maps.html"},{"title":"Accessing Entry Statistics","text":"Hazelcast keeps statistics about each map entry, such as creation time, last update time, last access time, number of hits, and version.

You can think of it as an entry listener with predicates. Please see the Listening for Map Events section for information on how to add entry listeners to a map. IMPORTANT: The default backwards-compatible event publishing strategy only publishes UPDATED events when map entries are updated to a value that matches the predicate with which the listener was registered. This implies that when using the default event publishing strategy, your listener will not be notified about an entry whose value is updated from one that matches the predicate to a new value that does not match the predicate. Since version 3.7, when you configure Hazelcast members with property hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types set to true, handling of entry updates conceptually treats value transition as entry, update or exit with regards to the predicate value space. The following table compares how a listener is notified about an update to a map entry value under the default backwards-compatible Hazelcast behavior (when property hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types is not set or is set to false) versus when set to true: \u00c2 Default hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types = true When old value matches predicate,new value does not match predicate No event is delivered to entry listener REMOVED event is delivered to entry listener When old value matches predicate,new value matches predicate UPDATED event is delivered to entry listener UPDATED event is delivered to entry listener When old value does not match predicate,new value does not match predicate No event is delivered to entry listener No event is delivered to entry listener When old value does not match predicate,new value matches predicate UPDATED event is delivered to entry listener ADDED event is delivered to entry listener As an example, let's listen to the changes made on an employee with the surname &quot;Smith&quot;.

You can change the returned value from a get operation, change the value in put, or cancel operations by throwing an exception. Interceptors are different from listeners. With listeners, you take an action after the operation has been completed. Interceptor actions are synchronous and you can alter the behavior of operation, change its values, or totally cancel it. Map interceptors are chained, so adding the same interceptor multiple times to the same map can result in duplicate effects. This can easily happen when the interceptor is added to the map at member initialization, so that each member adds the same interceptor. When you add the interceptor in this way, be sure to implement the hashCode() method to return the same value for every instance of the interceptor. It is not strictly necessary, but it is a good idea to also implement equals() as this will ensure that the map interceptor can be removed reliably. The IMap API has two methods for adding and removing an interceptor to the map: addInterceptor and removeInterceptor. \/** * Adds an interceptor for the map. Added interceptor intercepts operations * and executes user defined methods and cancels operations if * user defined methods throw exceptions. * * @param interceptor map interceptor. * @return id of registered interceptor. *\/ String addInterceptor( MapInterceptor interceptor ); \/** * Removes the given interceptor for this map.

For example, on a cluster with five members having 10 GB of data and 25 GB heap size per member, a single call of IMap.entrySet() fetches 50 GB of data and crashes the calling instance. A call of IMap.values() may return too much data for a single member. This can also happen with a real query and an unlucky choice of predicates, especially when the parameters are chosen by a user of your application. To prevent this, you can configure a maximum result size limit for query based operations. This is not a limit like SELECT * FROM map LIMIT 100, which you can achieve by a Paging Predicate. A maximum result size limit for query based operations is meant to be a last line of defense to prevent your members from retrieving more data than they can handle. The Hazelcast component which calculates this limit is the QueryResultSizeLimiter. Setting Query Result Size Limit If the QueryResultSizeLimiter is activated, it calculates a result size limit per partition. Each QueryOperation runs on all partitions of a member, so it collects result entries as long as the member limit is not exceeded. If that happens, a QueryResultSizeExceededException is thrown and propagated to the calling instance. This feature depends on an equal distribution of the data on the cluster members to calculate the result size limit per member. Therefore, there is a minimum value defined in QueryResultSizeLimiter.MINIMUM_MAX_RESULT_LIMIT. Configured values below the minimum will be increased to the minimum. Local Pre-check In addition to the distributed result size check in the QueryOperations, there is a local pre-check on the calling instance. If you call the method from a client, the pre-check is executed on the member that invokes the QueryOperations. Since the local pre-check can increase the latency of a QueryOperation, you can configure how many local partitions should be considered for the pre-check, or you can deactivate the feature completely. Scope of Result Size Limit Besides the designated query operations, there are other operations that use predicates internally. Those method calls will throw the QueryResultSizeExceededException as well. Please see the following matrix to see the methods that are covered by the query result size limit. Configuring Query Result Size The query result size limit is configured via the following system properties. hazelcast.query.result.size.limit: Result size limit for query operations on maps. This value defines the maximum number of returned elements for a single query result. If a query exceeds this number of elements, a QueryResultSizeExceededException is thrown. hazelcast.query.max.local.partition.limit.for.precheck: Maximum value of local partitions to trigger local pre-check for TruePredicate query operations on maps.

Taking Items off the Queue Now, let's create a Consumer class to take a message from this queue, as shown below. import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.IQueue; public class ConsumerMember { public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IQueue&lt;Integer&gt; queue = hz.getQueue( &quot;queue&quot; ); while ( true ) { int item = queue.take(); System.out.println( &quot;Consumed: &quot; + item ); if ( item == -1 ) { queue.put( -1 ); break; } Thread.sleep( 5000 ); } System.out.println( &quot;Consumer Finished!&quot; ); } } As seen in the above example code, Consumer waits five seconds before it consumes the next message. It stops once it receives -1. Also note that Consumer puts -1 back on the queue before the loop is ended. When you first start Producer and then start Consumer, items produced on the queue will be consumed from the same queue. Balancing the Queue Operations From the above example code, you can see that an item is produced every second and consumed every five seconds. Therefore, the consumer keeps growing. To balance the produce\/consume operation, let's start another consumer. This way, consumption is distributed to these two consumers, as seen in the sample outputs below. The second consumer is started. After a while, here is the first consumer output: ... Consumed 13 Consumed 15 Consumer 17 ... Here is the second consumer output: ... Consumed 14 Consumed 16 Consumer 18 ... In the case of a lot of producers and consumers for the queue, using a list of queues may solve the queue bottlenecks. In this case, be aware that the order of the messages sent to different queues is not guaranteed. Since in most cases strict ordering is not important, a list of queues is a good solution. NOTE: The items are taken from the queue in the same order they were put on the queue. However, if there is more than one consumer, this order is not guaranteed. ItemIDs When Offering Items Hazelcast gives an itemId for each item you offer, which is an incrementing sequence identification for the queue items. You should consider the following to understand the itemId assignment behavior: When a Hazelcast member has a queue, and that queue is configured to have at least one backup, and that member is restarted, the itemId assignment resumes from the last known highest itemId before the restart; itemId assignment does not start from the beginning for the new items. When the whole cluster is restarted, the same behavior explained in the above consideration applies if your queue has a persistent data store (QueueStore). If the queue has QueueStore, the itemId for the new items are given, starting from the highest itemId found in the IDs returned by the method loadAllKeys. If the method loadAllKeys does not return anything, the itemIds will started from the beginning after a cluster restart.

Once the queue size reaches this value, put operations will be blocked until the queue size goes below max-size, which happens when a consumer removes items from the queue. Let's set 10 as the maximum size of our example queue in Creating an Example Queue. &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;queue name=&quot;queue&quot;&gt; &lt;max-size&gt;10&lt;\/max-size&gt; &lt;\/queue&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; When the producer is started, ten items are put into the queue and then the queue will not allow more put operations.

This means that the producer can put more items into the queue until there are ten items in the queue again, at which point the put operation again becomes blocked. In this example code, the producer is five times faster than the consumer. It will effectively always be waiting for the consumer to remove items before it can put more on the queue. For this example code, if maximum throughput is the goal, it would be a good option to start multiple consumers to prevent the queue from filling up.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Queue\/Setting_a_Bounded_Queue.html"},{"title":"Queue with Persistence Datastore","text":"Hazelcast allows you to load and store the distributed queue items from\/to a persistent datastore using the interface QueueStore. If queue store is enabled, each item added to the queue will also be stored at the configured queue store. When the number of items in the queue exceeds the memory limit, the subsequent items are persisted in the queue store, they are not stored in the queue memory. The QueueStore interface enables you to store, load, and delete queue items with methods like store, storeAll, load and delete. The following example class includes all of the QueueStore methods. public class TheQueueStore implements QueueStore&lt;Item&gt; { @Override public void delete(Long key) { System.out.println(&quot;delete&quot;); } @Override public void store(Long key, Item value) { System.out.println(&quot;store&quot;); } @Override public void storeAll(Map&lt;Long, Item&gt; map) { System.out.println(&quot;store all&quot;); } @Override public void deleteAll(Collection&lt;Long&gt; keys) { System.out.println(&quot;deleteAll&quot;); } @Override public Item load(Long key) { System.out.println(&quot;load&quot;); return null; } @Override public Map&lt;Long, Item&gt; loadAll(Collection&lt;Long&gt; keys) { System.out.println(&quot;loadAll&quot;); return null; } @Override public Set&lt;Long&gt; loadAllKeys() { System.out.println(&quot;loadAllKeys&quot;); return null; } Item must be serializable.

Binary: By default, Hazelcast stores the queue items in serialized form, and before it inserts the queue items into the , it deserializes them. If you are not reaching the queue store from an external application, you might prefer that the items be inserted in binary form. Do this by setting the binary property to true: then you can get rid of the deserialization step, which is a performance optimization. The binary property is false by default. Memory Limit: This is the number of items after which Hazelcast will store items only to the datastore. For example, if the memory limit is 1000, then the 1001st item will be put only to the datastore. This feature is useful when you want to avoid out-of-memory conditions. If you want to always use memory, you can set it to Integer.MAX_VALUE. The default number for memory-limit is 1000. Bulk Load: When the queue is initialized, items are loaded from QueueStore in bulks. Bulk load is the size of these bulks. The default value of bulk-load is 250.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Queue\/Queue_with_Persistence_Datastore.html"},{"title":"Split-Brain Protection for Queue","text":"Queues can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying queue operations (see Split-Brain Protection).

By having this backup, when a cluster member with a queue goes down, another member having the backup of that queue will continue. Therefore, no items are lost. You can define the number of synchronous backups for a queue using the backup-count element in the declarative configuration. A queue can also have asynchronous backups: you can define the number of asynchronous backups using the async-backup-count element. To set the maximum size of the queue, use the max-size element. To purge unused or empty queues after a period of time, use the empty-queue-ttl element. If you define a value (time in seconds) for the empty-queue-ttl element, then your queue will be destroyed if it stays empty or unused for the time in seconds that you give. The following is the full list of queue configuration elements with their descriptions. max-size: Maximum number of items in the queue. It is used to set an upper bound for the queue. You will not be able to put more items when the queue reaches to this maximum size whether you have a queue store configured or not. backup-count: Number of synchronous backups. Queue is a non-partitioned data structure, so all entries of a queue reside in one partition.

Just like any other distributed data structure implementation in Hazelcast, MultiMap is distributed and thread-safe. Hazelcast MultiMap is not an implementation of java.util.Map due to the difference in method signatures. It supports most features of Hazelcast Map except for indexing, predicates and MapLoader\/MapStore. Yet, like Hazelcast Map, entries are almost evenly distributed onto all cluster members. When a new member joins the cluster, the same ownership logic used in the distributed map applies. Getting a MultiMap and Putting an Entry The following example creates a MultiMap and puts items into it. Use the HazelcastInstance getMultiMap method to get the MultiMap, then use the MultiMap put method to put an entry into the MultiMap. public class PutMember { public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); MultiMap &lt;String , String &gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( &quot;map&quot; ); map.put( &quot;a&quot;, &quot;1&quot; ); map.put( &quot;a&quot;, &quot;2&quot; ); map.put( &quot;b&quot;, &quot;3&quot; ); System.out.println( &quot;PutMember:Done&quot; ); } } Now let's print the entries in this MultiMap. public class PrintMember { public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); MultiMap &lt;String, String &gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( &quot;map&quot; ); for ( String key : map.keySet() ){ Collection &lt;String &gt; values = map.get( key ); System.out.println( &quot;%s -&gt; %s\\n&quot;,key, values ); } } } After you run the first code sample, run the PrintMember sample. You will see the key a has two values, as shown below. b -&gt; [3] a -&gt; [2, 1] Hazelcast MultiMap uses EntryListener to listen to events which occur when entries are added to, updated in or removed from the MultiMap. Please refer to the Listening for MultiMap Events section for information on how to create an entry listener class and register it. Configuring MultiMap When using MultiMap, the collection type of the values can be either Set or List. Configure the collection type with the valueCollectionType parameter. If you choose Set, duplicate and null values are not allowed in your collection and ordering is irrelevant. If you choose List, ordering is relevant and your collection can include duplicate and null values. You can also enable statistics for your MultiMap with the statisticsEnabled parameter. If you enable statisticsEnabled, statistics can be retrieved with getLocalMultiMapStats() method. NOTE: Currently, eviction is not supported for the MultiMap data structure.

Hazelcast Set cannot be scaled beyond the capacity of a single machine. Since the whole set lives on a single partition, storing a large amount of data on a single set may cause memory pressure. Therefore, you should use multiple sets to store a large amount of data. This way, all the sets will be spread across the cluster, sharing the load.

You can think of it as a circular array with a given capacity. Each Ringbuffer has a tail and a head. The tail is where the items are added and the head is where the items are overwritten or expired. You can reach each element in a Ringbuffer using a sequence ID, which is mapped to the elements between the head and tail (inclusive) of the Ringbuffer. Getting a Ringbuffer and Reading Items Reading from Ringbuffer is simple: get the Ringbuffer with the HazelcastInstance getRingbuffer method, get its current head with the headSequence method, and start reading. Use the method readOne to return the item at the given sequence; readOne blocks if no item is available. To read the next item, increment the sequence by one. Ringbuffer&lt;String&gt; ringbuffer = hz.getRingbuffer(&quot;rb&quot;); long sequence = ringbuffer.headSequence(); while(true){ String item = ringbuffer.readOne(sequence); sequence++; ... process item } By exposing the sequence, you can now move the item from the Ringbuffer as long as the item is still available. If the item is not available any longer, StaleSequenceException is thrown. Adding Items to a Ringbuffer Adding an item to a Ringbuffer is also easy with the Ringbuffer add method: Ringbuffer&lt;String&gt; ringbuffer = hz.getRingbuffer(&quot;rb&quot;); ringbuffer.add(&quot;someitem&quot;) Use the method add to return the sequence of the inserted item; the sequence value will always be unique. You can use this as a very cheap way of generating unique IDs if you are already using Ringbuffer. IQueue vs. Ringbuffer Hazelcast Ringbuffer can sometimes be a better alternative than an Hazelcast IQueue. Unlike IQueue, Ringbuffer does not remove the items, it only reads items using a certain position. There are many advantages to this approach: The same item can be read multiple times by the same thread. This is useful for realizing semantics of read-at-least-once or read-at-most-once. The same item can be read by multiple threads. Normally you could use an IQueue per thread for the same semantic, but this is less efficient because of the increased remoting. A take from an IQueue is destructive, so the change needs to be applied for backup also, which is why a queue.take() is more expensive than a ringBuffer.read(...). Reads are extremely cheap since there is no change in the Ringbuffer. Therefore no replication is required. Reads and writes can be batched to speed up performance. Batching can dramatically improve the performance of Ringbuffer.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Ringbuffer\/index.html"},{"title":"Configuring Ringbuffer","text":"Capacity By default, a Ringbuffer is configured with a capacity of 10000 items. This creates an array with a size of 10000. If a time-to-live is configured, then an array of longs is also created that stores the expiration time for every item. In a lot of cases you may want to change this capacity number to something that better fits your needs. Below is a declarative configuration example of a Ringbuffer with a capacity of 2000 items. &lt;ringbuffer name=&quot;rb&quot;&gt; &lt;capacity&gt;2000&lt;\/capacity&gt; &lt;\/ringbuffer&gt; Currently, Hazelcast Ringbuffer is not a partitioned data structure; its data is stored in a single partition and the replicas are stored in another partition. Therefore, create a Ringbuffer that can safely fit in a single cluster member. Back Up Hazelcast Ringbuffer has a single synchronous backup by default. You can control the Ringbuffer backup just like most of the other Hazelcast distributed data structures by setting the synchronous and asynchronous backups: backup-count and async-backup-count. In the example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with no synchronous backups and one asynchronous backup: &lt;ringbuffer name=&quot;rb&quot;&gt; &lt;backup-count&gt;0&lt;\/backup-count&gt; &lt;async-backup-count&gt;1&lt;\/async-backup-count&gt; &lt;\/ringbuffer&gt; An asynchronous backup will probably give you better performance. However, there is a chance that the item added will be lost when the member owning the primary crashes before the backup could complete. You may want to consider batching methods if you need high performance but do not want to give up on consistency. Time To Live You can configure Hazelcast Ringbuffer with a time to live in seconds. Using this setting, you can control how long the items remain in the Ringbuffer before they are expired. By default, the time to live is set to 0, meaning that unless the item is overwritten, it will remain in the Ringbuffer indefinitely. If you set a time to live and an item is added, then, depending on the Overflow Policy, either the oldest item is overwritten, or the call is rejected. In the example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with a time to live of 180 seconds. &lt;ringbuffer name=&quot;rb&quot;&gt; &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;180&lt;\/time-to-live-seconds&gt; &lt;\/ringbuffer&gt; Overflow Policy Using the overflow policy, you can determine what to do if the oldest item in the Ringbuffer is not old enough to expire when more items than the configured Ringbuffer capacity are being added. The below options are currently available. OverflowPolicy.OVERWRITE: The oldest item is overwritten. OverflowPolicy.FAIL: The call is aborted. The methods that make use of the OverflowPolicy return -1 to indicate that adding the item has failed. Overflow policy gives you fine control on what to do if the Ringbuffer is full. You can also use the overflow policy to apply a back pressure mechanism. The following example code shows the usage of an exponential backoff. long sleepMs = 100; for (; ; ) { long result = ringbuffer.addAsync(item, OverflowPolicy.FAIL).get(); if (result != -1) { break; } TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(sleepMs); sleepMs = min(5000, sleepMs * 2); } In-Memory Format You can configure Hazelcast Ringbuffer with an in-memory format that controls the format of the Ringbuffer's stored items. By default, BINARY in-memory format is used, meaning that the object is stored in a serialized form. You can select the OBJECT in-memory format, which is useful when filtering is applied or when the OBJECT in-memory format has a smaller memory footprint than BINARY. In the declarative configuration example below, a Ringbuffer is configured with the OBJECT in-memory format: &lt;ringbuffer name=&quot;rb&quot;&gt; &lt;in-memory-format&gt;BINARY&lt;\/in-memory-format&gt; &lt;\/ringbuffer&gt; Configuration Examples The following shows the declarative configuration of a Ringbuffer called rb. The configuration is modeled after the Ringbuffer defaults. &lt;ringbuffer name=&quot;rb&quot;&gt; &lt;capacity&gt;10000&lt;\/capacity&gt; &lt;backup-count&gt;1&lt;\/backup-count&gt; &lt;async-backup-count&gt;0&lt;\/async-backup-count&gt; &lt;time-to-live-seconds&gt;0&lt;\/time-to-live-seconds&gt; &lt;in-memory-format&gt;BINARY&lt;\/in-memory-format&gt; &lt;\/ringbuffer&gt; You can also configure a Ringbuffer programmatically. The following is a programmatic version of the above declarative configuration. RingbufferConfig rbConfig = new RingbufferConfig(&quot;rb&quot;) .setCapacity(10000) .setBackupCount(1) .setAsyncBackupCount(0) .setTimeToLiveSeconds(0) .setInMemoryFormat(InMemoryFormat.BINARY); Config config = new Config(); config.addRingbufferConfig(rbConfig);","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Ringbuffer\/Configuring_Ringbuffer.html"},{"title":"Ringbuffer with Persistent Datastore","text":"Hazelcast allows you to load and store the Ringbuffer items from\/to a persistent datastore using the interface RingbufferStore. If a Ringbuffer store is enabled, each item added to the Ringbuffer will also be stored at the configured Ringbuffer store. If the Ringbuffer store is configured, you can get items with sequences which are no longer in the actual Ringbuffer but are only in the Ringbuffer store. This will probably be much slower but still allow you to continue consuming items from the Ringbuffer even if they are overwritten with newer items in the Ringbuffer. When a Ringbuffer is being instantiated, it will check if the Ringbuffer store is configured and will request the latest sequence in the Ringbuffer store. This is to enable the Ringbuffer to start with sequences larger than the ones in the Ringbuffer store. In this case, the Ringbuffer is empty but you can still request older items from it (which will be loaded from the Ringbuffer store). The Ringbuffer store will store items in the same format as the Ringbuffer. If the BINARY in-memory format is used, the Ringbuffer store must implement the interface RingbufferStore&lt;byte[]&gt; meaning that the Ringbuffer will receive items in the binary format. If the OBJECT in-memory format is used, the Ringbuffer store must implement the interface RingbufferStore&lt;K&gt;, where K is the type of item being stored (meaning that the Ringbuffer store will receive the deserialized object). When adding items to the Ringbuffer, the method storeAll allows you to store items in batches. The following example class includes all of the RingbufferStore methods. public class TheRingbufferObjectStore implements RingbufferStore&lt;Item&gt; { @Override public void store(long sequence, Item data) { System.out.println(&quot;Object store&quot;); } @Override public void storeAll(long firstItemSequence, Item[] items) { System.out.println(&quot;Object store all&quot;); } @Override public Item load(long sequence) { System.out.println(&quot;Object load&quot;); return null; } @Override public long getLargestSequence() { System.out.println(&quot;Object get largest sequence&quot;); return -1; } } Item must be serializable.

Please see the Overflow Policy section for more information. Reading Batched Items In the previous example, the readOne method read items from the Ringbuffer. readOne is simple but not very efficient for the following reasons: readOne does not use batching. readOne cannot filter items at the source; the items need to be retrieved before being filtered. The method readManyAsync can read a batch of items and can filter items at the source. Please see the following example code. ICompletableFuture&lt;ReadResultSet&lt;E&gt;&gt; readManyAsync( long startSequence, int minCount, int maxCount, IFunction&lt;E, Boolean&gt; filter); The meanings of the readManyAsync arguments are given below. startSequence: Sequence of the first item to read. minCount: Minimum number of items to read. If you do not want to block, set it to 0. If you want to block for at least one item, set it to 1. maxCount: Maximum number of the items to retrieve. Its value cannot exceed 1000. filter: A function that accepts an item and checks if it should be returned. If no filtering should be applied, set it to null. A full example is given below. long sequence = rb.headSequence(); for(;;) { ICompletableFuture&lt;ReadResultSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; f = rb.readManyAsync(sequence, 1, 10, null); ReadResultSet&lt;String&gt; rs = f.get(); for (String s : rs) { System.out.println(s); } sequence+=rs.readCount(); } Please take a careful look at how your sequence is being incremented. You cannot always rely on the number of items being returned if the items are filtered out.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Ringbuffer\/Batched_Items.html"},{"title":"Using Async Methods","text":"Hazelcast Ringbuffer provides asynchronous methods for more powerful operations like batched writing or batched reading with filtering. To make these methods synchronous, just call the method get() on the returned future. Please see the following example code. ICompletableFuture f = ringbuffer.addAsync(item, OverflowPolicy.FAIL); f.get(); However, you can also use ICompletableFuture to get notified when the operation has completed. The advantage of ICompletableFuture is that the thread used for the call is not blocked till the response is returned. Please see the below code as an example of when you want to get notified when a batch of reads has completed.

This is also known as a publish\/subscribe (pub\/sub) messaging model. Publishing and subscribing operations are cluster wide. When a member subscribes to a topic, it is actually registering for messages published by any member in the cluster, including the new members that joined after you add the listener. NOTE: Publish operation is async. It does not wait for operations to run in remote members; it works as fire and forget.

When a new member is registered for a topic, it sends a registration message to all members in the cluster. Also, when a new member joins the cluster, it will receive all registrations made so far in the cluster. The behavior of a topic varies depending on the value of the configuration parameter globalOrderEnabled. Ordering Messages as Published If globalOrderEnabled is disabled, messages are not ordered and listeners (subscribers) process the messages in the order that the messages are published. If cluster member M publishes messages m1, m2, m3, ..., mn to a topic T, then Hazelcast makes sure that all of the subscribers of topic T will receive and process m1, m2, m3, ..., mn in the given order. Here is how it works. Let's say that we have three members (member1, member2 and member3) and that member1 and member2 are registered to a topic named news. Note that all three members know that member1 and member2 are registered to news. In this example, member1 publishes two messages, a1 and a2, and member3 publishes two messages, c1 and c2. When member1 and member3 publish a message, they will check their local list for registered members, they will discover that member1 and member2 are in their lists, and then they will fire messages to those members. One possible order of the messages received could be the following. member1 -&gt; c1, a1, a2, c2 member2 -&gt; c1, c2, a1, a2 Ordering Messages for Members If globalOrderEnabled is enabled, all members listening to the same topic will get its messages in the same order. Here is how it works. Let's say that we have three members (member1, member2 and member3) and that member1 and member2 are registered to a topic named news. Note that all three members know that member1 and member2 are registered to news. In this example, member1 publishes two messages: a1 and a2, and member3 publishes two messages: c1 and c2. When a member publishes messages over the topic news, it first calculates which partition the news ID corresponds to. Then it sends an operation to the owner of the partition for that member to publish messages. Let's assume that news corresponds to a partition that member2 owns. member1 and member3 first sends all messages to member2. Assume that the messages are published in the following order: member1 -&gt; a1, c1, a2, c2 member2 then publishes these messages by looking at registrations in its local list. It sends these messages to member1 and member2 (it makes a local dispatch for itself). member1 -&gt; a1, c1, a2, c2 member2 -&gt; a1, c1, a2, c2 This way we guarantee that all members will see the events in the same order. Keeping Generated and Published Order the Same In both cases, there is a StripedExecutor in EventService that is responsible for dispatching the received message. For all events in Hazelcast, the order that events are generated and the order they are published to the user are guaranteed to be the same via this StripedExecutor. In StripedExecutor, there are as many threads as are specified in the property hazelcast.event.thread.count (default is five). For a specific event source (for a particular topic name), hash of that source's name % 5 gives the ID of the responsible thread. Note that there can be another event source (entry listener of a map, item listener of a collection, etc.) corresponding to the same thread. In order not to make other messages to block, heavy processing should not be done in this thread. If there is time-consuming work that needs to be done, the work should be handed over to another thread.

The Reliable Topic uses the same ITopic interface as a regular topic. The main difference is that Reliable Topic is backed up by the Ringbuffer (also introduced with Hazelcast 3.5) data structure. The following are the advantages of this approach: Events are not lost since the Ringbuffer is configured with one synchronous backup by default. Each Reliable ITopic gets its own Ringbuffer; if a topic has a very fast producer, it will not lead to problems at topics that run at a slower pace. Since the event system behind a regular ITopic is shared with other data structures, e.g., collection listeners, you can run into isolation problems. This does not happen with the Reliable ITopic. Sample Reliable ITopic Code import com.hazelcast.core.Topic; import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.MessageListener; public class Sample implements MessageListener&lt;MyEvent&gt; { public static void main( String[] args ) { Sample sample = new Sample(); HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); ITopic topic = hazelcastInstance.getReliableTopic( &quot;default&quot; ); topic.addMessageListener( sample ); topic.publish( new MyEvent() ); } public void onMessage( Message&lt;MyEvent&gt; message ) { MyEvent myEvent = message.getMessageObject(); System.out.println( &quot;Message received = &quot; + myEvent.toString() ); } } You can configure the Reliable ITopic using its Ringbuffer. If a Reliable Topic has the name Foo, then you can configure this topic by adding a ReliableTopicConfig for a Ringbuffer with the name Foo. By default, a Ringbuffer does not have any TTL (time to live) and it has a limited capacity; you may want to change that configuration. By default, the Reliable ITopic uses a shared thread pool. If you need better isolation, you can configure a custom executor on the ReliableTopicConfig. Because the reads on a Ringbuffer are not destructive, batching is easy to apply. ITopic uses read batching and reads ten items at a time (if available) by default. Slow Consumers The Reliable ITopic provides control and a way to deal with slow consumers. It is unwise to keep events for a slow consumer in memory indefinitely since you do not know when the slow consumer is going to catch up. You can control the size of the Ringbuffer by using its capacity. For the cases when a Ringbuffer runs out of its capacity, you can specify the following policies for the TopicOverloadPolicy configuration: DISCARD_OLDEST: Overwrite the oldest item, even if a TTL is set. In this case the fast producer supersedes a slow consumer. DISCARD_NEWEST: Discard the newest item. BLOCK: Wait until the items are expired in the Ringbuffer. ERROR: Immediately throw TopicOverloadException if there is no space in the Ringbuffer. Configuring Reliable Topic The following are example Reliable Topic configurations. Declarative: &lt;reliable-topic name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; &lt;statistics-enabled&gt;true&lt;\/statistics-enabled&gt; &lt;message-listeners&gt; &lt;message-listener&gt; ... &lt;\/message-listener&gt; &lt;\/message-listeners&gt; &lt;read-batch-size&gt;10&lt;\/read-batch-size&gt; &lt;topic-overload-policy&gt;BLOCK&lt;\/topic-overload-policy&gt; &lt;\/reliable-topic&gt; Programmatic: Config config = new Config(); ReliableTopicConfig rtConfig = config.getReliableTopicConfig(); rtConfig.setTopicOverloadPolicy( TopicOverloadPolicy.BLOCK ) .setReadBatchSize( 10 ) .setStatisticsEnabled( true ); Reliable Topic configuration has the following elements. statistics-enabled: Enables or disables the statistics collection for the Reliable Topic. The default value is true. message-listener: Message listener class that listens to the messages when they are added or removed. read-batch-size: Minimum number of messages that Reliable Topic will try to read in batches. The default value is 10. topic-overload-policy: Policy to handle an overloaded topic. Available values are DISCARD_OLDEST, DISCARD_NEWEST, BLOCK and ERROR. The default value is `BLOCK. Please see the Slow Consumers section above for definitions of these policies.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Reliable_Topic.html"},{"title":"Lock","text":"ILock is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock, meaning that if you lock using an ILock, the critical section that it guards is guaranteed to be executed by only one thread in the entire cluster. Even though locks are great for synchronization, they can lead to problems if not used properly. Also note that Hazelcast Lock does not support fairness. Using Try-Catch Blocks with Locks Always use locks with try-catch blocks. This will ensure that locks are released if an exception is thrown from the code in a critical section. Also note that the lock method is outside the try-catch block because we do not want to unlock if the lock operation itself fails. import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock; HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Lock lock = hazelcastInstance.getLock( &quot;myLock&quot; ); lock.lock(); try { \/\/ do something here } finally { lock.unlock(); } Releasing Locks with tryLock Timeout If a lock is not released in the cluster, another thread that is trying to get the lock can wait forever. To avoid this, use tryLock with a timeout value. You can set a high value (normally it should not take that long) for tryLock. You can check the return value of tryLock as follows: if ( lock.tryLock ( 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) ) { try { \/\/ do some stuff here.. } finally { lock.unlock(); } } else { \/\/ warning } Avoiding Waiting Threads with Lease Time You can also avoid indefinitely waiting threads by using lock with lease time--the lock will be released in the given lease time. The lock can be safely unlocked before the lease time expires. Note that the unlock operation can throw an IllegalMonitorStateException if the lock is released because the lease time expires. If that is the case, critical section guarantee is broken. Please see the below example. lock.lock( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) try { \/\/ do some stuff here.. } finally { try { lock.unlock(); } catch ( IllegalMonitorStateException ex ){ \/\/ WARNING Critical section guarantee can be broken } } You can also specify a lease time when trying to acquire a lock: tryLock(time, unit, leaseTime, leaseUnit). In that case, it tries to acquire the lock within the specified lease time. If the lock is not available, the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes until either it acquires the lock or the specified waiting time elapses. Note that this lease time cannot be longer than the time you specify with the system property hazelcast.lock.max.lease.time.seconds. Please see the System Properties section to see the description of this property and to learn how to set a system property. Understanding Lock Behavior Locks are fail-safe. If a member holds a lock and some other members go down, the cluster will keep your locks safe and available. Moreover, when a member leaves the cluster, all the locks acquired by that dead member will be removed so that those locks are immediately available for live members. Locks are re-entrant. The same thread can lock multiple times on the same lock. Note that for other threads to be able to require this lock, the owner of the lock must call unlock as many times as the owner called lock. In the split-brain scenario, the cluster behaves as if it were two different clusters. Since two separate clusters are not aware of each other, two members from different clusters can acquire the same lock. For more information on places where split brain syndrome can be handled, please see split brain syndrome. Locks are not automatically removed. If a lock is not used anymore, Hazelcast will not automatically garbage collect the lock. This can lead to an OutOfMemoryError. If you create locks on the fly, make sure they are destroyed. Hazelcast IMap also provides locking support on the entry level with the method IMap.lock(key). Although the same infrastructure is used, IMap.lock(key) is not an ILock and it is not possible to expose it directly. Synchronizing Threads with ICondition ICondition is the distributed implementation of the notify, notifyAll and wait operations on the Java object. You can use it to synchronize threads across the cluster. More specifically, you use ICondition when a thread's work depends on another thread's output. A good example is producer\/consumer methodology. Please see the below code examples for a producer\/consumer implementation. Producer thread: HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Lock lock = hazelcastInstance.getLock( &quot;myLockId&quot; ); ICondition condition = lock.newCondition( &quot;myConditionId&quot; ); lock.lock(); try { while ( !shouldProduce() ) { condition.await(); \/\/ frees the lock and waits for signal \/\/ when it wakes up it re-acquires the lock \/\/ if available or waits for it to become \/\/ available } produce(); condition.signalAll(); } finally { lock.unlock(); } NOTE: The method await() takes time value and time unit as arguments. If you specify a negative value for the time, it is interpreted as infinite. Consumer thread: HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Lock lock = hazelcastInstance.getLock( &quot;myLockId&quot; ); ICondition condition = lock.newCondition( &quot;myConditionId&quot; ); lock.lock(); try { while ( !canConsume() ) { condition.await(); \/\/ frees the lock and waits for signal \/\/ when it wakes up it re-acquires the lock if \/\/ available or waits for it to become \/\/ available } consume(); condition.signalAll(); } finally { lock.unlock(); } Split-Brain Protection for Lock Locks can be configured to check for a minimum number of available members before applying lock operations (see Split-Brain Protection). This is a check to avoid performing successful lock operations on all parts of a cluster during a network partition. Due to the implementation details, the check does not guarantee that the lock will fail in all conditions of a network partition and it can happen that two members can acquire the same lock. Once the membership change has been detected, the lock operations will fail with a QuorumException if enough size of members are not present. In essence, this does not provide correctness but rather narrows down the window of opportunity in which locks can continue operations on several members concurrently. Although the check does not provide correctness it can still be useful. In cases where members acquire the lock to perform some costly but idempotent operation, configuring lock quorum can further prevent some cases where the cluster has been split into several sub-clusters and more than one member perform the same operation. Following is a list of methods that now support quorum checks. The list is grouped by quorum type. Additionally, since Hazelcast IMap also provides locking support, certain map and multimap methods also allow quorum checks. WRITE, READ_WRITE Condition#await, Condition#awaitUninterruptibly, Condition#awaitNanos, Condition#awaitUntil Lock#lockInterruptibly, ILock#lock, IMap#tryLock, IMap#lock, MultiMap#lock, MultiMap#tryLock Condition#signal, Condition#signalAll READ, READ_WRITE ILock#getLockCount ILock#getRemainingLeaseTime ILock#isLocked, IMap#isLocked, MultiMap#isLocked ILock#forceUnlock, IMap#forceUnlock, MultiMap#forceUnlock, ILock#unlock, IMap#unlock, ObjectMultiMapProxy#unlock Lock Configuration As mentioned in the Split-brain Protection for Lock section, Lock allows for split-brain protection. An example of declarative configuration is as follows: &lt;lock name=&quot;myLock&quot;&gt; &lt;quorum-ref&gt;quorum-name&lt;\/quorum-ref&gt; &lt;\/lock&gt; quorum-ref : Name of quorum configuration that you want this lock to use. An example of programmatic configuration is as follows: Config config = new Config(); LockConfig lockConfig = new LockConfig(); lockConfig.setName(&quot;myLock&quot;) .setQuorumName(&quot;quorum-name&quot;); config.addLockConfig(lockConfig); NOTE: As mentioned above, a quorum definition for a lock that has the same name or a pattern that matches a map name will force the map locking actions to use the defined quorum. It is important to keep this in mind when using lock quorum and map locking actions.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Lock.html"},{"title":"IAtomicLong","text":"Hazelcast IAtomicLong is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong. It offers most of AtomicLong's operations such as get, set, getAndSet, compareAndSet and incrementAndGet. Since IAtomicLong is a distributed implementation, these operations involve remote calls and thus their performances differ from AtomicLong. The following example code creates an instance, increments it by a million, and prints the count. public class Member { public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IAtomicLong counter = hazelcastInstance.getAtomicLong( &quot;counter&quot; ); for ( int k = 0; k &lt; 1000 * 1000; k++ ) { if ( k % 500000 == 0 ) { System.out.println( &quot;At: &quot; + k ); } counter.incrementAndGet(); } System.out.printf( &quot;Count is %s\\n&quot;, counter.get() ); } } When you start other instances with the code above, you will see the count as member count times a million. Sending Functions to IAtomicLong You can send functions to an IAtomicLong. IFunction is a Hazelcast owned, single method interface. The following sample IFunction implementation adds two to the original value. private static class Add2Function implements IFunction &lt;Long, Long&gt; { @Override public Long apply( Long input ) { return input + 2; } } Executing Functions on IAtomicLong You can use the following methods to execute functions on IAtomicLong. apply: Applies the function to the value in IAtomicLong without changing the actual value and returning the result. alter: Alters the value stored in the IAtomicLong by applying the function. It will not send back a result. alterAndGet: Alters the value stored in the IAtomicLong by applying the function, storing the result in the IAtomicLong and returning the result. getAndAlter: Alters the value stored in the IAtomicLong by applying the function and returning the original value. The following sample code includes these methods. public class Member { public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IAtomicLong atomicLong = hazelcastInstance.getAtomicLong( &quot;counter&quot; ); atomicLong.set( 1 ); long result = atomicLong.apply( new Add2Function() ); System.out.println( &quot;apply.result: &quot; + result); System.out.println( &quot;apply.value: &quot; + atomicLong.get() ); atomicLong.set( 1 ); atomicLong.alter( new Add2Function() ); System.out.println( &quot;alter.value: &quot; + atomicLong.get() ); atomicLong.set( 1 ); result = atomicLong.alterAndGet( new Add2Function() ); System.out.println( &quot;alterAndGet.result: &quot; + result ); System.out.println( &quot;alterAndGet.value: &quot; + atomicLong.get() ); atomicLong.set( 1 ); result = atomicLong.getAndAlter( new Add2Function() ); System.out.println( &quot;getAndAlter.result: &quot; + result ); System.out.println( &quot;getAndAlter.value: &quot; + atomicLong.get() ); } } Reasons to Use Functions with IAtomic The reason for using a function instead of a simple code line like atomicLong.set(atomicLong.get() + 2)); is that the IAtomicLong read and write operations are not atomic. Since IAtomicLong is a distributed implementation, those operations can be remote ones, which may lead to race problems. By using functions, the data is not pulled into the code, but the code is sent to the data. This makes it more scalable. NOTE: IAtomicLong has one synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. Its backup count is not configurable.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/IAtomicLong.html"},{"title":"ISemaphore","text":"Hazelcast ISemaphore is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.Semaphore. Controlling Thread Counts with Permits Semaphores offer permits to control the thread counts when performing concurrent activities. To execute a concurrent activity, a thread grants a permit or waits until a permit becomes available. When the execution is completed, the permit is released. NOTE: ISemaphore with a single permit may be considered a lock. Unlike the locks, however, when semaphores are used, any thread can release the permit, and semaphores can have multiple permits. NOTE: Hazelcast ISemaphore does not support fairness at all times. There are some edge cases where the fairness is not honored, e.g., when the permit becomes available at the time when an internal timeout occurs. When a permit is acquired on ISemaphore: if there are permits, the number of permits in the semaphore is decreased by one and the calling thread performs its activity. If there is contention, the longest waiting thread will acquire the permit before all other threads. if no permits are available, the calling thread blocks until a permit becomes available. When a timeout happens during this block, the thread is interrupted. Example Semaphore Code The following example code uses an IAtomicLong resource 1000 times, increments the resource when a thread starts to use it, and decrements it when the thread completes. public class SemaphoreMember { public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception{ HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); ISemaphore semaphore = hazelcastInstance.getSemaphore( &quot;semaphore&quot; ); IAtomicLong resource = hazelcastInstance.getAtomicLong( &quot;resource&quot; ); for ( int k = 0 ; k &lt; 1000 ; k++ ) { System.out.println( &quot;At iteration: &quot; + k + &quot;, Active Threads: &quot; + resource.get() ); semaphore.acquire(); try { resource.incrementAndGet(); Thread.sleep( 1000 ); resource.decrementAndGet(); } finally { semaphore.release(); } } System.out.println(&quot;Finished&quot;); } } Let's limit the concurrent access to this resource by allowing at most three threads. You can configure it declaratively by setting the initial-permits property, as shown below. &lt;semaphore name=&quot;semaphore&quot;&gt; &lt;initial-permits&gt;3&lt;\/initial-permits&gt; &lt;\/semaphore&gt; NOTE: If there is a shortage of permits while the semaphore is being created, value of this property can be set to a negative number. If you execute the above SemaphoreMember class 5 times, the output will be similar to the following: At iteration: 0, Active Threads: 1 At iteration: 1, Active Threads: 2 At iteration: 2, Active Threads: 3 At iteration: 3, Active Threads: 3 At iteration: 4, Active Threads: 3 As you can see, the maximum count of concurrent threads is equal or smaller than three. If you remove the semaphore acquire\/release statements in SemaphoreMember, you will see that there is no limitation on the number of concurrent usages. Hazelcast also provides backup support for ISemaphore. When a member goes down, you can have another member take over the semaphore with the permit information (permits are automatically released when a member goes down). To enable this, configure synchronous or asynchronous backup with the properties backup-count and async-backup-count (by default, synchronous backup is already enabled). Configuring Semaphore The following are example semaphore configurations. Declarative: &lt;semaphore name=&quot;semaphore&quot;&gt; &lt;backup-count&gt;1&lt;\/backup-count&gt; &lt;async-backup-count&gt;0&lt;\/async-backup-count&gt; &lt;initial-permits&gt;3&lt;\/initial-permits&gt; &lt;\/semaphore&gt; Programmatic: Config config = new Config(); SemaphoreConfig semaphoreConfig = config.getSemaphoreConfig(); semaphoreConfig.setName( &quot;semaphore&quot; ).setBackupCount( &quot;1&quot; ) .setInitialPermits( &quot;3&quot; ); Semaphore configuration has the below elements. initial-permits: the thread count to which the concurrent access is limited. For example, if you set it to &quot;3&quot;, concurrent access to the object is limited to 3 threads. backup-count: Number of synchronous backups. async-backup-count: Number of asynchronous backups. NOTE: If high performance is more important than not losing the permit information, you can disable the backups by setting backup-count to 0.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/ISemaphore.html"},{"title":"IAtomicReference","text":"The IAtomicLong is very useful if you need to deal with a long, but in some cases you need to deal with a reference. That is why Hazelcast also supports the IAtomicReference which is the distributed version of the java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference. Here is an IAtomicReference example. public class Member { public static void main(String[] args) { Config config = new Config(); HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); IAtomicReference&lt;String&gt; ref = hz.getAtomicReference(&quot;reference&quot;); ref.set(&quot;foo&quot;); System.out.println(ref.get()); System.exit(0); } } When you execute the above example, you will see the following output. foo Sending Functions to IAtomicReference Just like IAtomicLong, IAtomicReference has methods that accept a 'function' as an argument, such as alter, alterAndGet, getAndAlter and apply. There are two big advantages of using these methods: From a performance point of view, it is better to send the function to the data then the data to the function. Often the function is a lot smaller than the data and therefore cheaper to send over the line. Also the function only needs to be transferred once to the target machine, and the data needs to be transferred twice. You do not need to deal with concurrency control. If you would perform a load, transform, store, you could run into a data race since another thread might have updated the value you are about to overwrite. Using IAtomicReference Below are some issues you need to know when you use IAtomicReference. IAtomicReference works based on the byte-content and not on the object-reference. If you use the compareAndSet method, do not change to original value because its serialized content will then be different. It is also important to know that if you rely on Java serialization, sometimes (especially with hashmaps) the same object can result in different binary content. IAtomicReference will always have one synchronous backup. All methods returning an object will return a private copy. You can modify the private copy, but the rest of the world will be shielded from your changes. If you want these changes to be visible to the rest of the world, you need to write the change back to the IAtomicReference; but be careful about introducing a data-race. The 'in-memory format' of an IAtomicReference is binary. The receiving side does not need to have the class definition available unless it needs to be deserialized on the other side, e.g., because a method like 'alter' is executed. This deserialization is done for every call that needs to have the object instead of the binary content, so be careful with expensive object graphs that need to be deserialized. If you have an object with many fields or an object graph, and you only need to calculate some information or need a subset of fields, you can use the apply method. With the apply method, the whole object does not need to be sent over the line; only the information that is relevant is sent.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/IAtomicReference.html"},{"title":"ICountDownLatch","text":"Hazelcast ICountDownLatch is the distributed implementation of java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch. Gate-Keeping Concurrent Activities CountDownLatch is considered to be a gate keeper for concurrent activities. It enables the threads to wait for other threads to complete their operations. The following code samples describe the mechanism of ICountDownLatch. Assume that there is a leader process and there are follower processes that will wait until the leader completes. Here is the leader: public class Leader { public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); ICountDownLatch latch = hazelcastInstance.getCountDownLatch( &quot;countDownLatch&quot; ); System.out.println( &quot;Starting&quot; ); latch.trySetCount( 1 ); Thread.sleep( 30000 ); latch.countDown(); System.out.println( &quot;Leader finished&quot; ); latch.destroy(); } } Since only a single step is needed to be completed as a sample, the above code initializes the latch with 1. Then, the code sleeps for a while to simulate a process and starts the countdown. Finally, it clears up the latch. Let's write a follower: public class Follower { public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); ICountDownLatch latch = hazelcastInstance.getCountDownLatch( &quot;countDownLatch&quot; ); System.out.println( &quot;Waiting&quot; ); boolean success = latch.await( 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS ); System.out.println( &quot;Complete: &quot; + success ); } } The follower class above first retrieves ICountDownLatch and then calls the await method to enable the thread to listen for the latch. The method await has a timeout value as a parameter. This is useful when the countDown method fails. To see ICountDownLatch in action, start the leader first and then start one or more followers. You will see that the followers will wait until the leader completes. Recovering From Failure In a distributed environment, the counting down cluster member may go down. In this case, all listeners are notified immediately and automatically by Hazelcast. The state of the current process just before the failure should be verified and 'how to continue now' should be decided, e.g., restart all process operations, continue with the first failed process operation, and throw an exception. Using ICountDownLatch Although the ICountDownLatch is a very useful synchronization aid, you will probably not use it on a daily basis. Unlike Java\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implementation, Hazelcast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ICountDownLatch count can be reset after a countdown has finished, but not during an active count. NOTE: ICountDownLatch has 1 synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. Its backup count is not configurable. Also, the count cannot be re-set during an active count, it should be re-set after the countdown is finished.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/ICountDownLatch.html"},{"title":"IdGenerator","text":"Hazelcast IdGenerator is used to generate cluster-wide unique identifiers. Generated identifiers are long type primitive values between 0 and Long.MAX_VALUE. Generating Cluster-Wide IDs ID generation occurs almost at the speed of AtomicLong.incrementAndGet(). A group of 10,000 identifiers is allocated for each cluster member. In the background, this allocation takes place with an IAtomicLong incremented by 10,000. Once a cluster member generates IDs (allocation is done), IdGenerator increments a local counter. If a cluster member uses all IDs in the group, it will get another 10,000 IDs. This way, only one time of network traffic is needed, meaning that 9,999 identifiers are generated in memory instead of over the network. This is fast. Let's write a sample identifier generator. public class IdGeneratorExample { public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IdGenerator idGen = hazelcastInstance.getIdGenerator( &quot;newId&quot; ); while (true) { Long id = idGen.newId(); System.err.println( &quot;Id: &quot; + id ); Thread.sleep( 1000 ); } } } Let's run the above code two times.

If you see duplicated identifiers, it means your instances could not form a cluster. NOTE: Generated IDs are unique during the life cycle of the cluster. If the entire cluster is restarted, IDs start from 0, again or you can initialize to a value using the init() method of IdGenerator.

Its backup count is not configurable.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/IdGenerator.html"},{"title":"Replicated Map","text":"A Replicated Map is a distributed key-value data structure where the data is replicated to all members in the cluster. It provides full replication of entries to all members for high speed access. The following are its features: When you have a Replicated Map in the cluster, your clients can communicate with any cluster member. All cluster members are able to perform write operations. It supports all methods of the interface java.util.Map. It supports automatic initial fill up when a new member is started. It provides statistics for entry access, write and update so that you can monitor it using Hazelcast Management Center. New members joining to the cluster pull all the data from the existing members. You can listen to entry events using listeners. Please refer to the Using EntryListener on Replicated Map section below. Replicating Instead of Partitioning A Replicated Map does not partition data (it does not spread data to different cluster members); instead, it replicates the data to all members. All other data structures are partitioned in design. Replication leads to higher memory consumption. However, a Replicated Map has faster read and write access since the data is available on all members. Writes could take place on local\/remote members in order to provide write-order, eventually being replicated to all other members. Replicated Map is suitable for objects, catalog data, or idempotent calculable data (such as HTML pages). It fully implements the java.util.Map interface, but it lacks the methods from java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap since there are no atomic guarantees to writes or reads. NOTE: If Replicated Map is used from a dummy client and this dummy client is connected to a lite member, the entry listeners cannot be registered\/de-registered. NOTE: You cannot use Replicated Map from a lite member. A com.hazelcast.replicatedmap.ReplicatedMapCantBeCreatedOnLiteMemberException is thrown if com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance#getReplicatedMap(name) is invoked on a lite member. Example Replicated Map Code Here is an example of Replicated Map code. The HazelcastInstance's getReplicatedMap method gets the Replicated Map, and the Replicated Map's put method creates map entries. import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import java.util.Collection; import java.util.Map; HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getReplicatedMap(&quot;customers&quot;); customers.put( &quot;1&quot;, new Customer( &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Smith&quot; ) ); customers.put( &quot;2&quot;, new Customer( &quot;Ali&quot;, &quot;Selam&quot; ) ); customers.put( &quot;3&quot;, new Customer( &quot;Avi&quot;, &quot;Noyan&quot; ) ); Collection&lt;Customer&gt; colCustomers = customers.values(); for ( Customer customer : colCustomers ) { \/\/ process customer } HazelcastInstance::getReplicatedMap returns com.hazelcast.core.ReplicatedMap which, as stated above, extends the java.util.Map interface. The com.hazelcast.core.ReplicatedMap interface has some additional methods for registering entry listeners or retrieving values in an expected order. Considerations for Replicated Map If you have a large cluster or very high occurrences of updates, the Replicated Map may not scale linearly as expected since it has to replicate update operations to all members in the cluster. Since the replication of updates is performed in an asynchronous manner, we recommend you enable back pressure in case your system has high occurrences of updates. Please refer to the Back Pressure section to learn how to enable it. Replicated Map has an anti-entropy system that will converge values to a common one if some of the members are missing replication updates. Replicated Map does not guarantee eventual consistency because there are some edge cases that fail to provide consistency. Replicated Map uses the internal partition system of Hazelcast in order to serialize updates happening on the same key at the same time. This happens by sending updates of the same key to the same Hazelcast member in the cluster. Due to the asynchronous nature of replication, a Hazelcast member could die before successfully replicating a &quot;write&quot; operation to other members after sending the &quot;write completed&quot; response to its caller during the write process. In this scenario, Hazelcast's internal partition system will promote one of the replicas of the partition as the primary one. The new primary partition will not have the latest &quot;write&quot; since the dead member could not successfully replicate the update. (This will leave the system in a state that the caller is the only one that has the update and the rest of the cluster have not.) In this case even the anti-entropy system simply could not converge the value since the source of true information is lost for the update. This leads to a break in the eventual consistency because different values can be read from the system for the same key. Other than the aforementioned scenario, the Replicated Map will behave like an eventually consistent system with read-your-writes consistency. Configuration Design for Replicated Map There are several technical design decisions you should consider when you configure a Replicated Map. Initial Provisioning If a new member joins the cluster, there are two ways you can handle the initial provisioning that is executed to replicate all existing values to the new member. Each involves how you configure the async fill up. First, you can configure async fill up to true, which does not block reads while the fill up operation is underway. That way, you have immediate access on the new member, but it will take time until all the values are eventually accessible. Not yet replicated values are returned as non-existing (null). Second, you can configure for a synchronous initial fill up (by configuring the async fill up to false), which blocks every read or write access to the map until the fill up operation is finished. Use this with caution since it might block your application from operating. Configuring Replicated Map Replicated Map can be configured programmatically or declaratively. Replicated Map Declarative Configuration You can declare your Replicated Map configuration in the Hazelcast configuration file hazelcast.xml. Please see the following example. &lt;replicatedmap name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; &lt;in-memory-format&gt;BINARY&lt;\/in-memory-format&gt; &lt;async-fillup&gt;true&lt;\/async-fillup&gt; &lt;statistics-enabled&gt;true&lt;\/statistics-enabled&gt; &lt;entry-listeners&gt; &lt;entry-listener include-value=&quot;true&quot;&gt; com.hazelcast.examples.EntryListener &lt;\/entry-listener&gt; &lt;\/entry-listeners&gt; &lt;\/replicatedmap&gt; in-memory-format: Internal storage format. Please see the In-Memory Format section below. The default value is OBJECT. async-fillup: Specifies whether the Replicated Map is available for reads before the initial replication is completed. The default value is true. If set to false (i.e., synchronous initial fill up), no exception will be thrown when the Replicated Map is not yet ready, but null values can be seen until the initial replication is completed. statistics-enabled: If set to true, the statistics such as cache hits and misses are collected. The default value is true. entry-listener: Full canonical classname of the EntryListener implementation. entry-listener#include-value: Specifies whether the event includes the value or not. Sometimes the key is enough to react on an event. In those situations, setting this value to false will save a deserialization cycle. The default value is true. entry-listener#local: Not used for Replicated Map since listeners are always local. Replicated Map Programmatic Configuration You can configure a Replicated Map programmatically, as you can do for all other data structures in Hazelcast. You must create the configuration upfront, when you instantiate the HazelcastInstance. A basic example of how to configure the Replicated Map using the programmatic approach is shown in the following snippet. Config config = new Config(); ReplicatedMapConfig replicatedMapConfig = config.getReplicatedMapConfig( &quot;default&quot; ); replicatedMapConfig.setInMemoryFormat( InMemoryFormat.BINARY ); All properties that can be configured using the declarative configuration are also available using programmatic configuration by transforming the tag names into getter or setter names. In-Memory Format on Replicated Map Currently, two in-memory-format values are usable with the Replicated Map. OBJECT (default): The data will be stored in deserialized form. This configuration is the default choice since the data replication is mostly used for high speed access. Please be aware that changing the values without a Map::put is not reflected on the other members but is visible on the changing members for later value accesses. BINARY: The data is stored in serialized binary format and has to be deserialized on every request. This option offers higher encapsulation since changes to values are always discarded as long as the newly changed object is not explicitly Map::put into the map again. Using EntryListener on Replicated Map A com.hazelcast.core.EntryListener used on a Replicated Map serves the same purpose as it would on other data structures in Hazelcast. You can use it to react on add, update, and remove operations. Replicated Maps do not yet support eviction. Difference in EntryListener on Replicated Map The fundamental difference in Replicated Map behavior, compared to the other data structures, is that an EntryListener only reflects changes on local data. Since replication is asynchronous, all listener events are fired only when an operation is finished on a local member. Events can fire at different times on different members. Example of Replicated Map EntryListener Here is a code example for using EntryListener on a Replicated Map. The HazelcastInstance's getReplicatedMap method gets a Replicated Map (customers), and the ReplicatedMap's addEntryListener method adds an entry listener to the Replicated Map. Then, the ReplicatedMap's put method adds a Replicated Map entry and updates it. The method remove removes the entry. import com.hazelcast.core.EntryEvent; import com.hazelcast.core.EntryListener; import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import com.hazelcast.core.ReplicatedMap; HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); ReplicatedMap&lt;String, Customer&gt; customers = hazelcastInstance.getReplicatedMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); customers.addEntryListener( new EntryListener&lt;String, Customer&gt;() { @Override public void entryAdded( EntryEvent&lt;String, Customer&gt; event ) { log( &quot;Entry added: &quot; + event ); } @Override public void entryUpdated( EntryEvent&lt;String, Customer&gt; event ) { log( &quot;Entry updated: &quot; + event ); } @Override public void entryRemoved( EntryEvent&lt;String, Customer&gt; event ) { log( &quot;Entry removed: &quot; + event ); } @Override public void entryEvicted( EntryEvent&lt;String, Customer&gt; event ) { \/\/ Currently not supported, will never fire } }); customers.put( &quot;1&quot;, new Customer( &quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;Smith&quot; ) ); \/\/ add event customers.put( &quot;1&quot;, new Customer( &quot;Ali&quot;, &quot;Selam&quot; ) ); \/\/ update event customers.remove( &quot;1&quot; ); \/\/ remove event","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Data_Structures\/Replicated_Map.html"},{"title":"Cardinality Estimator Service","text":"Hazelcast's cardinality estimator service is a data structure which implements Flajolet's HyperLogLog algorithm for estimating cardinalities of unique objects in theoretically huge data sets.

If no listener is registered, then no event will be created. If you provided a predicate when you registered the event listener, pass the predicate before sending the event to the listener (member\/client). As a rule of thumb, your event listener should not implement heavy processes in its event methods that block the thread for a long time.

For each partition, one of your cluster members becomes the owner and some of the other members become replica members, based on your configuration. Nevertheless, data loss may occur if a few members crash simultaneously. Let`s consider the following example with three members: N1, N2, N3 for a given partition-0. N1 is owner of partition-0, and N2 and N3 are the first and second replicas respectively. If N1 and N2 crash simultaneously, partition-0 loses its data that is configured with less than two backups. For instance, if we configure a map with one backup, that map loses its data in partition-0 since both owner and first replica of partition-0 have crashed. However, if we configure our map with two backups, it does not lose any data since a copy of partition-0's data for the given map also resides in N3. The Partition Lost Listener notifies for possible data loss occurrences with the information of how many replicas are lost for a partition. It listens to PartitionLostEvent instances. Partition lost events are dispatched per partition. Partition loss detection is done after a member crash is detected by the other members and the crashed member is removed from the cluster.

The following is an example output. com.hazelcast.partition.PartitionLostEvent{partitionId=242, lostBackupCount=0, eventSource=Address[192.168.2.49]:5701} Registering Partition Lost Listeners After you create your class, you can configure your cluster programmatically or declaratively to include the partition lost listener. Below is an example of its programmatic configuration. HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); hazelcastInstance.getPartitionService().addPartitionLostListener( new ConsoleLoggingPartitionLostListener() ); The following is an example of the equivalent declarative configuration. &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;partition-lost-listeners&gt; &lt;partition-lost-listener&gt; com.your-package.ConsoleLoggingPartitionLostListener &lt;\/partition-lost-listener&gt; &lt;\/partition-lost-listeners&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt;","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Events\/Event_Listener_for_Members\/Listening_for_Partition_Lost_Events.html"},{"title":"Listening for Lifecycle Events","text":"The Lifecycle Listener notifies for the following events: STARTING: A member is starting. STARTED: A member started. SHUTTING_DOWN: A member is shutting down. SHUTDOWN: A member's shutdown has completed. MERGING: A member is merging with the cluster. MERGED: A member's merge operation has completed. CLIENT_CONNECTED: A Hazelcast Client connected to the cluster. CLINET_DISCONNECTED: A Hazelcast Client disconnected from the cluster. The following is an example Lifecycle Listener class. public class NodeLifecycleListener implements LifecycleListener { @Override public void stateChanged(LifecycleEvent event) { System.err.println(event); } } This listener is local to an individual member. It notifies the application that uses Hazelcast about the events mentioned above for a particular member. Registering Lifecycle Listeners After you create your class, you can configure your cluster to include lifecycle listeners. Below is an example using the method addLifecycleListener. HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); hazelcastInstance.getLifecycleService().addLifecycleListener( new NodeLifecycleListener() ); With the above approach, there is the possibility of missing events between the creation of the instance and registering the listener. To overcome this race condition, Hazelcast allows you to register the listeners in the configuration. You can register listeners using declarative, programmatic, or Spring configuration, as shown below.

To listen to these events, implement a MapListener sub-interface. A map-wide event is fired as a result of a map-wide operation. For example, IMap#clear or IMap#evictAll. An entry-based event is fired after the operations that affect a specific entry. For example, IMap#remove or IMap#evict. Catching a Map Event To catch an event, you should explicitly implement a corresponding sub-interface of a MapListener, such as EntryAddedListener or MapClearedListener. NOTE: * The EntryListener interface still can be implemented (we kept it for backward compatibility reasons). However, if you need to listen to a different event, one that is not available in the EntryListener interface, you should also implement a relevant MapListener sub-interface.* Let's take a look at the following class example. public class Listen { public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hz.getMap( &quot;somemap&quot; ); map.addEntryListener( new MyEntryListener(), true ); System.out.println( &quot;EntryListener registered&quot; ); } static class MyEntryListener implements EntryAddedListener&lt;String, String&gt;, EntryRemovedListener&lt;String, String&gt;, EntryUpdatedListener&lt;String, String&gt;, EntryEvictedListener&lt;String, String&gt; , MapEvictedListener, MapClearedListener { @Override public void entryAdded( EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event ) { System.out.println( &quot;Entry Added:&quot; + event ); } @Override public void entryRemoved( EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event ) { System.out.println( &quot;Entry Removed:&quot; + event ); } @Override public void entryUpdated( EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event ) { System.out.println( &quot;Entry Updated:&quot; + event ); } @Override public void entryEvicted( EntryEvent&lt;String, String&gt; event ) { System.out.println( &quot;Entry Evicted:&quot; + event ); } @Override public void mapEvicted( MapEvent event ) { System.out.println( &quot;Map Evicted:&quot; + event ); } @Override public void mapCleared( MapEvent event ) { System.out.println( &quot;Map Cleared:&quot; + event ); } } } Now, let's perform some modifications on the map entries using the following example code. public class Modify { public static void main( String[] args ) { HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hz.getMap( &quot;somemap&quot;); String key = &quot;&quot; + System.nanoTime(); String value = &quot;1&quot;; map.put( key, value ); map.put( key, &quot;2&quot; ); map.delete( key ); } } If you execute the Listen class and then the Modify class, you get the following output produced by the Listen class. entryAdded:EntryEvent {Address[192.168.1.100]:5702} key=251359212222282, oldValue=null, value=1, event=ADDED, by Member [192.168.1.100]:5702 entryUpdated:EntryEvent {Address[192.168.1.100]:5702} key=251359212222282, oldValue=1, value=2, event=UPDATED, by Member [192.168.1.100]:5702 entryRemoved:EntryEvent {Address[192.168.1.100]:5702} key=251359212222282, oldValue=2, value=2, event=REMOVED, by Member [192.168.1.100]:5702 public class MyEntryListener implements EntryListener{ private Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5); @Override public void entryAdded(EntryEvent event) { executor.execute(new DoSomethingWithEvent(event)); } NOTE: Please note that the method IMap.clear() does not fire an &quot;EntryRemoved&quot; event, but fires a &quot;MapCleared&quot; event. Partitions and Entry Listeners A map listener runs on the event threads that are also used by the other listeners. For example, the collection listeners and pub\/sub message listeners. This means that the entry listeners can access other partitions. Consider this when you run long tasks, since listening to those tasks may cause the other map\/event listeners to starve. Listening for Lost Map Partitions You can listen to MapPartitionLostEvent instances by registering an implementation of MapPartitionLostListener, which is also a sub-interface of MapListener. Let`s consider the following example code: public static void main(String[] args) { Config config = new Config(); config.getMapConfig(&quot;map&quot;).setBackupCount(1); \/\/ might lose data if any member crashes HazelcastInstance instance = HazelcastInstanceFactory.newHazelcastInstance(config); IMap&lt;Object, Object&gt; map = instance1.getMap(&quot;map&quot;); map.put(0, 0); map.addPartitionLostListener(new MapPartitionLostListener() { @Override public void partitionLost(MapPartitionLostEvent event) { System.out.println(event); } }); } Within this example code, a MapPartitionLostListener implementation is registered to a map that is configured with one backup. For this particular map and any of the partitions in the system, if the partition owner member and its first backup member crash simultaneously, the given MapPartitionLostListener receives a corresponding MapPartitionLostEvent. If only a single member crashes in the cluster, there will be no MapPartitionLostEvent fired for this map since backups for the partitions owned by the crashed member are kept on other members. Please refer to Listening for Partition Lost Events for more information about partition lost detection and partition lost events. Registering Map Listeners After you create your listener class, you can configure your cluster to include map listeners using the method addEntryListener (as you can see in the example Listen class above). Below is the related portion from this code, showing how to register a map listener. HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hz.getMap( &quot;somemap&quot; ); map.addEntryListener( new MyEntryListener(), true ); With the above approach, there is the possibility of missing events between the creation of the instance and registering the listener.

This striped executor also guarantees the event order. For all events in Hazelcast, the order in which events are generated and the order in which they are published are guaranteed for given keys. For map and multimap, the order is preserved for the operations on the same key of the entry. For list, set, topic and queue, the order is preserved for events on that instance of the distributed data structure. To achieve the order guarantee, you make only one thread responsible for a particular set of events (entry events of a key in a map, item events of a collection, etc.) in StripedExecutor (within com.hazelcast.util.executor). If the event queue reaches its capacity (hazelcast.event.queue.capacity) and the last item cannot be put into the event queue for the period specified in hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis, these events will be dropped with a warning message, such as &quot;EventQueue overloaded&quot;. If event listeners perform a computation that takes a long time, the event queue can reach its maximum capacity and lose events.

In distributed systems, this implementation is not desired since you may want a task submitted in one JVM and processed in another one. Hazelcast offers IExecutorService for you to use in distributed environments. It implements java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService to serve the applications requiring computational and data processing power. With IExecutorService, you can execute tasks asynchronously and perform other useful tasks. If your task execution takes longer than expected, you can cancel the task execution. Tasks should be Serializable since they will be distributed. In the Java Executor framework, you implement tasks two ways: Callable or Runnable.

If you cannot stop\/cancel that task, it will keep eating your resources. To cancel a task, you can use the standard Java executor framework's cancel() API. This framework encourages us to code and design for cancellations, a highly ignored part of software development. Example Task to Cancel The Fibonacci callable class below calculates the Fibonacci number for a given number. In the calculate method, we check if the current thread is interrupted so that the code can respond to cancellations once the execution is started. public class Fibonacci&lt;Long&gt; implements Callable&lt;Long&gt;, Serializable { int input = 0; public Fibonacci() { } public Fibonacci( int input ) { this.input = input; } public Long call() { return calculate( input ); } private long calculate( int n ) { if ( Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() ) { return 0; } if ( n &lt;= 1 ) { return n; } else { return calculate( n - 1 ) + calculate( n - 2 ); } } } Example Method to Execute and Cancel the Task The fib() method below submits the Fibonacci calculation task above for number 'n' and waits a maximum of 3 seconds for the result. If the execution does not completed in three seconds, future.get() will throw a TimeoutException and upon catching it, we cancel the execution, saving some CPU cycles. long fib( int n ) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); IExecutorService es = hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService(); Future future = es.submit( new Fibonacci( n ) ); try { return future.get( 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS ); } catch ( TimeoutException e ) { future.cancel( true ); } return -1; } fib(20) will probably take less than 3 seconds. However, fib(50) will take much longer. (This is not an example for writing better Fibonacci calculation code, but for showing how to cancel a running execution that takes too long.) The method future.cancel(false) can only cancel execution before it is running (executing), but future.cancel(true) can interrupt running executions provided that your code is able to handle the interruption. If you are willing to cancel an already running task, then your task should be designed to handle interruptions. If the calculate (int n) method did not have the (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) line, then you would not be able to cancel the execution after it is started.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Computing\/Executor_Service\/Canceling_an_Executing_Task.html"},{"title":"Callback When Task Completes","text":"You can use the ExecutionCallback offered by Hazelcast to asynchronously be notified when the execution is done.

For example, you may want certain tasks to run only on certain members, or you may wish to implement some form of custom load balancing regime. The MemberSelector is an interface that you can implement and then provide to the IExecutorService when you submit or execute. The select(Member) method is called for every available member in the cluster. Implement this method to decide if the member is going to be used or not.

By this way, you do not lose any tasks if a member goes down or any results if the submitter (member or client) goes down while executing the task. When using the durable executor service you can either submit or execute a task randomly or on the owner of a provided key. Note that in executor service, you can submit or execute tasks to\/on the selected member(s). Processing of the tasks when using durable executor service involves two invocations: Sending the task to primary Hazelcast member (primary partition) and to its backups, if configured, and executing the task. Retrieving the result of the task. As you may already know, Hazelcast's executor service returns a future representing the task to the user. With the above two-invocations approach, it is guaranteed that the task is executed before the future returns and you can track the response of a submitted task with a unique ID. Hazelcast stores the task on both primary and backup members, and starts the execution also. With the first invocation, a Ringbuffer stores the task and a generated sequence for the task is returned to the caller as a result. In addition to the storing, the task is executed on the local execution service for the primary member. By this way, the task is now resilient to member failures and you are able to track the task with its ID. After the first invocation has completed and the sequence of task is returned, second invocation starts to retrieve the result of task with that sequence. This retrieval waits in the waiting operations queue until notified, or it runs immediately if the result is already available. When task execution is completed, Ringbuffer replaces the task with the result for the given task sequence. This replacement notifies the waiting operations queue.

More specifically, there are always one or more backups to take ownership of the task in the event of a lost member. If a member is lost, the task will be re-scheduled on the backup (new primary) member, which might induce further delays on the subsequent executions of the task. For example, if we schedule a task to run in 10 seconds from now, schedule(new ExampleTask(), 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); and after 5 seconds the owner member goes down (before the execution takes place), then the backup owner will re-schedule the task in 10 seconds from now. Therefore, from the user's perspective waiting on the result, this will be available in 10 + 5 = 15 seconds rather than 10 seconds as it is anticipated originally. If atFixedRate was used, then only the initial delay is affected in the above scenario, all subsequent executions should adhere to the given period parameter. Upon member specific scheduling, the future task is only stored in the member itself, which means that in the event of a lost member, the task will be lost as well. To accomplish the described durability, all tasks provide a unique identity\/name before the scheduling takes place. The name allows the service to reach the scheduled task even after the caller (client or member) goes down, and also allows helps to prevent duplicate tasks. The name of the task can be user-defined if it needs to be, by implementing the com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.NamedTask interface (plain wrapper util is available here: com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.TaskUtils#named(java.lang.String, java.lang.Runnable)). If the task does not provide a name in its implementation, the service provides a random UUID for it, internally. Upon scheduling, the service returns an IScheduledFuture which on top of the java.util.concurrent.ScheduledFuture functionality provides API to get the resource handler of the task ScheduledTaskHandler and also the runtime statistics of the task. Futures associated with a scheduled task act as listeners on the local member\/client, in order to be aware of the lost partitions and\/or members . Therefore, they are always strongly referenced on the member\/client side. In order to clean up their resources, you can use dispose() once completed. Dispose will also cancel further executions of the task if scheduled at fixed rate. Please see below for your reference: package com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor; import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledFuture; \/** * A delayed result-bearing action that can be cancelled. * Usually a scheduled future is the result of scheduling * a task with a IScheduledExecutorService. * * Enhances the default ScheduledFuture API with support * of statistics and time measurement info, through ScheduledTaskStatistics. *\/ public interface IScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt; extends ScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt; { \/** * Returns the scheduled future resource handler. * Can be used to re-acquire control of the IScheduledFuture using the * IScheduledExecutorService#getScheduledFuture(ScheduledTaskHandler) *\/ ScheduledTaskHandler getHandler(); \/** * Returns the statistics and time measurement info of the execution of this scheduled future * in the IScheduledExecutorService it was scheduled. *\/ ScheduledTaskStatistics getStats(); \/** * Used to destroy the instance of the IScheduledFuture in the scheduled executor. * Once the instance is destroyed, any subsequent action on the {@link IScheduledFuture} will * fail with an IllegalStateException. * Attempting to re-create the IScheduledFuture from the * IScheduledExecutorService#getScheduledFuture(ScheduledTaskHandler) using the #getHandler() * will succeed, but any subsequent access on that new future, will also fail with StaleTaskException *\/ void dispose(); \/** * Attempts to cancel further scheduling of this task.

Subsequent calls to #isCancelled * will always return true if this method returned true. *\/ boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning); } The task handler, is a descriptor class holding information for the scheduled future, which is used to pinpoint the actual task in the cluster. It contains the name of the task, the owner (member or partition) and the scheduler name. The handler is always available after scheduling and can be stored in a plain string format com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.ScheduledTaskHandler#toUrn and re-constructed back from that String com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.ScheduledTaskHandler#of. If the handler is lost, you can still find a task under a given scheduler by using the Scheduler's com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.IScheduledExecutorService#getAllScheduledFutures. Last but not least, similar to executor service, the scheduled executor service allows Stateful tasks to be scheduled. Stateful tasks, are tasks that require any kind of state during their runtime, which must also be durable along with the task in the event of a lost partition. Stateful tasks can be created by implementing the com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.StatefulTask interface, and providing implementation details for saving the state and loading it back. If a partition is lost, then the re-scheduled task will load the previously saved state before its execution. NOTE: As with the tasks, Objects stored in the state Map need to be Hazelcast serializable.

An entry processor is a function that executes your code on a map entry in an atomic way. An entry processor is a good option if you perform bulk processing on an IMap. Usually you perform a loop of keys-- executing IMap.get(key), mutating the value, and finally putting the entry back in the map using IMap.put(key,value). If you perform this process from a client or from a member where the keys do not exist, you effectively perform two network hops for each update: the first to retrieve the data and the second to update the mutated value. If you are doing the process described above, you should consider using entry processors. An entry processor executes a read and updates upon the member where the data resides. This eliminates the costly network hops described above. NOTE: Entry processor is meant to process a single entry per call. Processing multiple entries and data structures in an entry processor is not supported as it may result in deadlocks.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Computing\/Entry_Processor\/index.html"},{"title":"Performing Fast In-Memory Map Operations","text":"Performing Fast In-Memory Map Operations An entry processor enables fast in-memory operations on your map without you having to worry about locks or concurrency issues. You can apply it to a single map entry or to all map entries. Entry processors support choosing target entries using predicates. You do not need any explicit lock on entry thanks to the isolated threading model: Hazelcast runs the EntryProcessor for all entries on a partitionThread so there will NOT be any interleaving of the EntryProcessor and other mutations. Hazelcast sends the entry processor to each cluster member and these members apply it to map entries. Therefore, if you add more members, your processing completes faster. Using Indexes Entry processors can be used with predicates. Predicates help to process a subset of data by selecting eligible entries. This selection can happen either by doing a full-table scan or by using indexes. To accelerate entry selection step, you can consider to add indexes. If indexes are there, entry processor will automatically use them. Using OBJECT In-Memory Format If entry processing is the major operation for a map and if the map consists of complex objects, you should use OBJECT as the in-memory-format to minimize serialization cost. By default, the entry value is stored as a byte array (BINARY format). When it is stored as an object (OBJECT format), then the entry processor is applied directly on the object. In that case, no serialization or deserialization is performed. However, if there is a defined event listener, a new entry value will be serialized when passing to the event publisher service. NOTE: When in-memory-format is OBJECT, the old value of the updated entry will be null. Entry Processing with IMap Methods The methods below are in the IMap interface for entry processing. executeOnKey processes an entry mapped by a key. executeOnKeys processes entries mapped by a collection of keys. submitToKey processes an entry mapped by a key while listening to event status. executeOnEntries processes all entries in a map. executeOnEntries can also process all entries in a map with a defined predicate. \/** * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to the entry mapped by the key. * Returns the object which is the result of the process() method of EntryProcessor. *\/ Object executeOnKey( K key, EntryProcessor entryProcessor ); \/** * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to the entries mapped by the collection of keys. * Returns the results mapped by each key in the collection. *\/ Map&lt;K, Object&gt; executeOnKeys( Set&lt;K&gt; keys, EntryProcessor entryProcessor ); \/** * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to the entry mapped by the key with * specified ExecutionCallback to listen to event status and return immediately. *\/ void submitToKey( K key, EntryProcessor entryProcessor, ExecutionCallback callback ); \/** * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to all entries in the map. * Returns the results mapped by each key in the map. *\/ Map&lt;K, Object&gt; executeOnEntries( EntryProcessor entryProcessor ); \/** * Applies the user defined EntryProcessor to the entries in the map which satisfies provided predicate. * Returns the results mapped by each key in the map. *\/ Map&lt;K, Object&gt; executeOnEntries( EntryProcessor entryProcessor, Predicate predicate ); NOTE: Entry Processors run via Operation Threads that are dedicated to specific partitions.

This predicate is applied to the employee map using the map.values(predicate) method. This method sends the predicate to all cluster members and merges the results coming from them. Since the predicate is communicated between the members, it needs to be serializable. NOTE: Predicates can also be applied to keySet, entrySet and localKeySet of the Hazelcast distributed map. Predicates Class Operators The Predicates class offered by Hazelcast includes many operators for your query requirements. Some of them are explained below. equal: Checks if the result of an expression is equal to a given value. notEqual: Checks if the result of an expression is not equal to a given value. instanceOf: Checks if the result of an expression has a certain type. like: Checks if the result of an expression matches some string pattern. % (percentage sign) is the placeholder for many characters, (underscore) is placeholder for only one character. greaterThan: Checks if the result of an expression is greater than a certain value. greaterEqual: Checks if the result of an expression is greater than or equal to a certain value. lessThan: Checks if the result of an expression is less than a certain value. lessEqual: Checks if the result of an expression is less than or equal to a certain value. between: Checks if the result of an expression is between two values (this is inclusive). in: Checks if the result of an expression is an element of a certain collection. isNot: Checks if the result of an expression is false. regex: Checks if the result of an expression matches some regular expression.

With its PagingPredicate class, you can get a collection of keys, values, or entries page by page by filtering them with predicates and giving the size of the pages.

This predicate has a filter to retrieve the objects with an &quot;age&quot; greater than or equal to 18. Then a PagingPredicate is constructed in which the page size is 5, so there will be five objects in each page. The first time the values are called creates the first page. It gets subsequent pages with the nextPage() method of PagingPredicate and querying the map again with the updated PagingPredicate.

If you query your map a lot, make sure to add indexes for the most frequently queried fields. For example, if you do an active and age &lt; 30 query, make sure you add an index for the active and age fields.

It contains two methods: read(String path, ValueCollector&lt;T&gt; collector) - enables passing all results directly to the ValueCollector. read(String path, ValueCallback&lt;T&gt; callback) - enables filtering, transforming and grouping the result of the read operation and manually passing it to the ValueCollector. Here is the ValueReader contract: \/** * Enables reading the value of the attribute specified by the path * &lt;p&gt; * The path may be: * - simple -&gt; it includes a single attribute only, like &quot;name&quot; * - nested -&gt; it includes more then a single attribute separated with a dot (.), e.g. person.address.city * &lt;p&gt; * The path may also includes array cells: * - specific quantifier, like person.leg[1] -&gt; returns the leg with index 1 * - wildcard quantifier, like person.leg[any] -&gt; returns all legs * &lt;p&gt; * The wildcard quantifier may be used a couple of times, like person.leg[any].finger[any] which returns all fingers * from all legs. *\/ public abstract class ValueReader { \/** * Read the value of the attribute specified by the path and returns the result via the callback. * *\/ public abstract &lt;T&gt; void read(String path, ValueCallback&lt;T&gt; callback) throws ValueReadingException; \/** * Read the value of the attribute specified by the path and returns the result directly to the collector. * *\/ public abstract &lt;T&gt; void read(String path, ValueCollector&lt;T&gt; collector) throws ValueReadingException; } Returning Multiple Values from a Single Extraction It sounds counter-intuitive, but a single extraction may return multiple values when arrays or collections are involved. Let's have a look at the following data structure in pseudo-code: class Motorbike { Wheel wheel[2]; } class Wheel { String name; } Let's assume that we want to extract the names of all wheels from a single motorbike object. Each motorbike has two wheels so there are two names for each bike. In order to return both values from the extraction operation, collect them separately using the ValueCollector. Collecting multiple values in this way allows you to operate on these multiple values as if they were single values during the evaluation of the predicates. Let's assume that we registered a custom extractor with the name wheelName and executed the following query: wheelName = front-wheel. The extraction may return up to two wheel names for each Motorbike since each Motorbike has up to two wheels. In such a case, it is enough if a single value evaluates the predicate's condition to true to return a match, so it will return a Motorbike if &quot;any&quot; of the wheels matches the expression.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/Custom_Attributes\/Implementing_a_ValueExtractor.html"},{"title":"Extraction Arguments","text":"A ValueExtractor may use a custom argument if it is specified in the query.

The string incoming is an argument that will be passed to the ArgumentParser during the extraction. The parser will parse the string according to the parser's custom logic and it will return a parsed object. The parsed object may be a single object, array, collection, or any arbitrary object. It is up to the ValueExtractor's implementor to understand the semantics of the parsed argument object. For now it is not possible to register a custom ArgumentParser, thus a default parser is used. It follows a pass-through semantic, which means that the string located in the square brackets is passed &quot;as is&quot; to the ValueExtractor.extract() method.

With Hadoop as the most common and well known implementation, MapReduce gained a broad audience and made it into all kinds of business applications dominated by data warehouses. MapReduce is a software framework for processing large amounts of data in a distributed way. Therefore, the processing is normally spread over several machines. The basic idea behind MapReduce is that source data is mapped into a collection of key-value pairs and reducing those pairs, grouped by key, in a second step towards the final result. The main idea can be summarized with the following steps. Read the source data. Map the data to one or multiple key-value pairs. Reduce all pairs with the same key. Use Cases The best known examples for MapReduce algorithms are text processing tools, such as counting the word frequency in large texts or websites. Apart from that, there are more interesting examples of use cases listed below. Log Analysis Data Querying Aggregation and summing Distributed Sort ETL (Extract Transform Load) Credit and Risk management Fraud detection and more.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/MapReduce\/index.html"},{"title":"Understanding MapReduce","text":"This section will give deeper insight into the MapReduce pattern and will help you understand the semantics behind the different MapReduce phases and how they are implemented in Hazelcast. In addition to this, the following sections compare Hadoop and Hazelcast MapReduce implementations to help adopters with Hadoop backgrounds quickly get familiar with Hazelcast MapReduce. MapReduce Workflow Example The flowchart below demonstrates the basic workflow of the word count example (distributed occurrences analysis) mentioned in the introduction section. From left to right, it iterates over all the entries of a data structure (in this case an IMap). In the mapping phase, it splits the sentence into single words and emits a key-value pair per word: the word is the key, 1 is the value. In the next phase, values are collected (grouped) and transported to their corresponding reducers, where they are eventually reduced to a single key-value pair, the value being the number of occurrences of the word. At the last step, the different reducer results are grouped up to the final result and returned to the requester. In pseudo code, the corresponding map and reduce function would look like the following. A Hazelcast code example will be shown in the next section. map( key:String, document:String ):Void -&gt; for each w:word in document: emit( w, 1 ) reduce( word:String, counts:List[Int] ):Int -&gt; return sum( counts ) MapReduce Phases As seen in the workflow example, a MapReduce process consists of multiple phases. The original MapReduce pattern describes two phases (map, reduce) and one optional phase (combine). In Hazelcast, these phases either only exist virtually to explain the data flow, or are executed in parallel during the real operation while the general idea is still persisting. (K x V)* -&gt; (L x W)* [(k1, v1), ..., (kn, vn)] -&gt; [(l1, w1), ..., (lm, wm)] Mapping Phase The mapping phase iterates all key-value pairs of any kind of legal input source. The mapper then analyzes the input pairs and emits zero or more new key-value pairs. K x V -&gt; (L x W)* (k, v) -&gt; [(l1, w1), ..., (ln, wn)] Combine Phase In the combine phase, multiple key-value pairs with the same key are collected and combined to an intermediate result before being sent to the reducers. Combine phase is also optional in Hazelcast, but is highly recommended to lower the traffic. In terms of the word count example, this can be explained using the sentences &quot;Saturn is a planet but the Earth is a planet, too&quot;. As shown above, we would send two key-value pairs (planet, 1). The registered combiner now collects those two pairs and combines them into an intermediate result of (planet, 2). Instead of two key-value pairs sent through the wire, there is now only one for the key &quot;planet&quot;. The pseudo code for a combiner is similar to the reducer. combine( word:String, counts:List[Int] ):Void -&gt; emit( word, sum( counts ) ) Grouping \/ Shuffling Phase The grouping or shuffling phase only exists virtually in Hazelcast since it is not a real phase; emitted key-value pairs with the same key are always transferred to the same reducer in the same job. They are grouped together, which is equivalent to the shuffling phase. Reducing Phase In the reducing phase, the collected intermediate key-value pairs are reduced by their keys to build the final by-key result. This value can be a sum of all the emitted values of the same key, an average value, or something completely different, depending on the use case. Here is a reduced representation of this phase. L x W* -&gt; X* (l, [w1, ..., wn]) -&gt; [x1, ..., xn] Producing the Final Result This is not a real MapReduce phase, but it is the final step in Hazelcast after all reducers are notified that reducing has finished. The original job initiator then requests all reduced results and builds the final result. Additional MapReduce Resources The Internet is full of useful resources for finding deeper information on MapReduce. Below is a short collection of more introduction material. In addition, there are books written about all kinds of MapReduce patterns and how to write a MapReduce function for your use case. To name them all is out of the scope of this documentation, but here are some resources: http:\/\/research.google.com\/archive\/mapreduce.html http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MapReduce http:\/\/hci.stanford.edu\/courses\/cs448g\/a2\/files\/map_reduce_tutorial.pdf http:\/\/ksat.me\/map-reduce-a-really-simple-introduction-kloudo\/ http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/franebandov\/an-introduction-to-mapreduce-6789635","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/MapReduce\/Understanding_MapReduce.html"},{"title":"Using the MapReduce API","text":"This section explains the basics of the Hazelcast MapReduce framework. While walking through the different API classes, we will build the word count example that was discussed earlier and create it step by step. The Hazelcast API for MapReduce operations consists of a fluent DSL-like configuration syntax to build and submit jobs. JobTracker is the basic entry point to all MapReduce operations and is retrieved from com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance by calling getJobTracker and supplying the name of the required JobTracker configuration. The configuration for JobTrackers will be discussed later; for now we focus on the API itself. In addition, the complete submission part of the API is built to support a fully reactive way of programming. To give an easy introduction to people used to Hadoop, we created the class names to be as familiar as possible to their counterparts on Hadoop. That means while most users will recognize a lot of similar sounding classes, the way to configure the jobs is more fluent due to the DSL-like styled API. While building the example, we will go through as many options as possible, e.g., we will create a specialized JobTracker configuration (at the end). Special JobTracker configuration is not required, because for all other Hazelcast features you can use &quot;default&quot; as the configuration name. However, special configurations offer better options to predict behavior of the framework execution. The full example is available here as a ready to run Maven project. Retrieving a JobTracker Instance JobTracker creates Job instances, whereas every instance of com.hazelcast.mapreduce.Job defines a single MapReduce configuration. The same Job can be submitted multiple times regardless of whether it is executed in parallel or after the previous execution is finished. NOTE: After retrieving the JobTracker, be aware that it should only be used with data structures derived from the same HazelcastInstance. Otherwise, you can get unexpected behavior. To retrieve a JobTracker from Hazelcast, we will start by using the &quot;default&quot; configuration for convenience reasons to show the basic way. import com.hazelcast.mapreduce.*; JobTracker jobTracker = hazelcastInstance.getJobTracker( &quot;default&quot; ); JobTracker is retrieved using the same kind of entry point as most other Hazelcast features. After building the cluster connection, you use the created HazelcastInstance to request the configured (or default) JobTracker from Hazelcast. The next step will be to create a new Job and configure it to execute our first MapReduce request against cluster data. Creating a Job As mentioned in the Retrieving a JobTracker Instance section above, you create a Job using the retrieved JobTracker instance. A Job defines exactly one configuration of a MapReduce task. Mapper, combiner and reducers will be defined per job. However, since the Job instance is only a configuration, it can be submitted multiple times, regardless of whether executions happen in parallel or one after the other. A submitted job is always identified using a unique combination of the JobTracker's name and a jobId generated on submit-time. The way to retrieve the jobId will be shown in one of the later sections. To create a Job, a second class com.hazelcast.mapreduce.KeyValueSource is necessary. We will have a deeper look at the KeyValueSource class in the next section. KeyValueSource is used to wrap any kind of data or data structure into a well defined set of key-value pairs. The example code below is a direct follow up to the example in the Retrieving a JobTracker Instance section, and it reuses the already created HazelcastInstance and JobTracker instances. The example starts by retrieving an instance of our data map, and then it creates the Job instance. Implementations used to configure the Job will be discussed while walking further through the API documentation. NOTE: Since the Job class is highly dependent upon generics to support type safety, the generics change over time and may not be assignment compatible to old variable types. To make use of the full potential of the fluent API, we recommend you use fluent method chaining as shown in this example to prevent the need for too many variables. IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;articles&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMap( map ); Job&lt;String, String&gt; job = jobTracker.newJob( source ); ICompletableFuture&lt;Map&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt; future = job .mapper( new TokenizerMapper() ) .combiner( new WordCountCombinerFactory() ) .reducer( new WordCountReducerFactory() ) .submit(); \/\/ Attach a callback listener future.andThen( buildCallback() ); \/\/ Wait and retrieve the result Map&lt;String, Long&gt; result = future.get(); As seen above, we create the Job instance and define a mapper, combiner, and reducer. Then we submit the request to the cluster. The submit method returns an ICompletableFuture that can be used to attach our callbacks or to wait for the result to be processed in a blocking fashion. There are more options available for job configurations, such as defining a general chunk size or on what keys the operation will operate. For more information, please refer to the Hazelcast source code for Job.java. Creating Key-Value Input Sources with KeyValueSource KeyValueSource can either wrap Hazelcast data structures (like IMap, MultiMap, IList, ISet) into key-value pair input sources, or build your own custom key-value input source. The latter option makes it possible to feed Hazelcast MapReduce with all kinds of data, such as just-in-time downloaded web page contents or data files. People familiar with Hadoop will recognize similarities with the Input class. You can imagine a KeyValueSource as a bigger java.util.Iterator implementation. Whereas most methods must be implemented, implementing the getAllKeys method is optional. If implementation is able to gather all keys upfront, it should be implemented and isAllKeysSupported must return true. That way, Job configured KeyPredicates are able to evaluate keys upfront before sending them to the cluster. Otherwise they are serialized and transferred as well, to be evaluated at execution time. As shown in the example above, the abstract KeyValueSource class provides a number of static methods to easily wrap Hazelcast data structures into KeyValueSource implementations already provided by Hazelcast. The data structures' generics are inherited by the resulting KeyValueSource instance. For data structures like IList or ISet, the key type is always String. While mapping, the key is the data structure's name, whereas the value type and value itself are inherited from the IList or ISet itself. \/\/ KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.IMap IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;my-map&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMap( map ); \/\/ KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.MultiMap MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; multiMap = hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( &quot;my-multimap&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMultiMap( multiMap ); \/\/ KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.IList IList&lt;String&gt; list = hazelcastInstance.getList( &quot;my-list&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromList( list ); \/\/ KeyValueSource from com.hazelcast.core.ISet ISet&lt;String&gt; set = hazelcastInstance.getSet( &quot;my-set&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromSet( set ); PartitionIdAware The com.hazelcast.mapreduce.PartitionIdAware interface can be implemented by the KeyValueSource implementation if the underlying data set is aware of the Hazelcast partitioning schema (as it is for all internal data structures). If this interface is implemented, the same KeyValueSource instance is reused multiple times for all partitions on the cluster member. As a consequence, the close and open methods are also executed multiple times but once per partitionId. Implementing Mapping Logic with Mapper Using the Mapper interface, you will implement the mapping logic. Mappers can transform, split, calculate, and aggregate data from data sources. In Hazelcast you can also integrate data from more than the KeyValueSource data source by implementing com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstanceAware and requesting additional maps, multimaps, list, and\/or sets. The mappers map function is called once per available entry in the data structure. If you work on distributed data structures that operate in a partition-based fashion, multiple mappers work in parallel on the different cluster members on the members' assigned partitions. Mappers then prepare and maybe transform the input key-value pair and emit zero or more key-value pairs for the reducing phase. For our word count example, we retrieve an input document (a text document) and we transform it by splitting the text into the available words. After that, as discussed in the pseudo code, we emit every single word with a key-value pair with the word as the key and 1 as the value. A common implementation of that Mapper might look like the following example: public class TokenizerMapper implements Mapper&lt;String, String, String, Long&gt; { private static final Long ONE = Long.valueOf( 1L ); @Override public void map(String key, String document, Context&lt;String, Long&gt; context) { StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer( document.toLowerCase() ); while ( tokenizer.hasMoreTokens() ) { context.emit( tokenizer.nextToken(), ONE ); } } } This code splits the mapped texts into their tokens, iterates over the tokenizer as long as there are more tokens, and emits a pair per word. Note that we're not yet collecting multiple occurrences of the same word, we just fire every word on its own. LifecycleMapper \/ LifecycleMapperAdapter The LifecycleMapper interface or its adapter class LifecycleMapperAdapter can be used to make the Mapper implementation lifecycle aware. That means it will be notified when mapping of a partition or set of data begins and when the last entry was mapped. Only special algorithms might need those additional lifecycle events to prepare, clean up, or emit additional values. Minimizing Cluster Traffic with Combiner As stated in the introduction, a Combiner is used to minimize traffic between the different cluster members when transmitting mapped values from mappers to the reducers. It does this by aggregating multiple values for the same emitted key. This is a fully optional operation, but using it is highly recommended. Combiners can be seen as an intermediate reducer. The calculated value is always assigned back to the key for which the combiner initially was created. Since combiners are created per emitted key, the Combiner implementation itself is not defined in the jobs configuration; instead, a CombinerFactory that is able to create the expected Combiner instance is created. Because Hazelcast MapReduce is executing the mapping and reducing phases in parallel, the Combiner implementation must be able to deal with chunked data. Therefore, you must reset its internal state whenever you call finalizeChunk. Calling the finalizeChunk method creates a chunk of intermediate data to be grouped (shuffled) and sent to the reducers. Combiners can override beginCombine and finalizeCombine to perform preparation or cleanup work. For our word count example, we are going to have a simple CombinerFactory and Combiner implementation similar to the following example. public class WordCountCombinerFactory implements CombinerFactory&lt;String, Long, Long&gt; { @Override public Combiner&lt;Long, Long&gt; newCombiner( String key ) { return new WordCountCombiner(); } private class WordCountCombiner extends Combiner&lt;Long, Long&gt; { private long sum = 0; @Override public void combine( Long value ) { sum++; } @Override public Long finalizeChunk() { return sum; } @Override public void reset() { sum = 0; } } } The Combiner must be able to return its current value as a chunk and reset the internal state by setting sum back to 0. Since combiners are always called from a single thread, no synchronization or volatility of the variables is necessary. Doing Algorithm Work with Reducer Reducers do the last bit of algorithm work. This can be aggregating values, calculating averages, or any other work that is expected from the algorithm. Since values arrive in chunks, the reduce method is called multiple times for every emitted value of the creation key. This also can happen multiple times per chunk if no Combiner implementation was configured for a job configuration. Unlike combiners, a reducer's finalizeReduce method is only called once per reducer (which means once per key). Therefore, a reducer does not need to reset its internal state at any time. Reducers can override beginReduce to perform preparation work. For our word count example, the implementation will look similar to the following code example. public class WordCountReducerFactory implements ReducerFactory&lt;String, Long, Long&gt; { @Override public Reducer&lt;Long, Long&gt; newReducer( String key ) { return new WordCountReducer(); } private class WordCountReducer extends Reducer&lt;Long, Long&gt; { private volatile long sum = 0; @Override public void reduce( Long value ) { sum += value.longValue(); } @Override public Long finalizeReduce() { return sum; } } } Reducers Switching Threads Unlike combiners, reducers tend to switch threads if running out of data to prevent blocking threads from the JobTracker configuration. They are rescheduled at a later point when new data to be processed arrives, but are unlikely to be executed on the same thread as before. As of Hazelcast version 3.3.3 the guarantee for memory visibility on the new thread is ensured by the framework. This means the previous requirement for making fields volatile is dropped. Modifying the Result with Collator A Collator is an optional operation that is executed on the job emitting member and is able to modify the finally reduced result before returned to the user's codebase. Only special use cases are likely to use collators. For an imaginary use case, we might want to know how many words were all over in the documents we analyzed. For this case, a Collator implementation can be given to the submit method of the Job instance. A collator would look like the following snippet: public class WordCountCollator implements Collator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;, Long&gt; { @Override public Long collate( Iterable&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt; values ) { long sum = 0; for ( Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt; entry : values ) { sum += entry.getValue().longValue(); } return sum; } } The definition of the input type is a bit strange, but because Combiner and Reducer implementations are optional, the input type heavily depends on the state of the data. As stated above, collators are non-typical use cases and the generics of the framework always help in finding the correct signature. Preselecting Keys with KeyPredicate You can use KeyPredicate to pre-select whether or not a key should be selected for mapping in the mapping phase. If the KeyValueSource implementation is able to know all keys prior to execution, the keys are filtered before the operations are divided among the different cluster members. A KeyPredicate can also be used to select only a special range of data, e.g., a time frame, or in similar use cases. A basic KeyPredicate implementation that only maps keys containing the word &quot;hazelcast&quot; might look like the following code example: public class WordCountKeyPredicate implements KeyPredicate&lt;String&gt; { @Override public boolean evaluate( String s ) { return s != null &amp;&amp; s.toLowerCase().contains( &quot;hazelcast&quot; ); } } Job Monitoring with TrackableJob You can retrieve a TrackableJob instance after submitting a job. It is requested from the JobTracker using the unique jobId (per JobTracker). You can use it get runtime statistics of the job. The information available is limited to the number of processed (mapped) records and the processing state of the different partitions or members (if KeyValueSource is not PartitionIdAware). To retrieve the jobId after submission of the job, use com.hazelcast.mapreduce.JobCompletableFuture instead of the com.hazelcast.core.ICompletableFuture as the variable type for the returned future. The example code below gives a quick introduction on how to retrieve the instance and the runtime data. For more information, please have a look at the Javadoc corresponding your running Hazelcast version. The example performs the following steps to get the job instance. It gets the map with the hazelcastInstance getMap method. From the map, it gets the source with the KeyValueSource fromMap method. From the source, it gets a job with the JobTracker newJob method. IMap&lt;String, String&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;articles&quot; ); KeyValueSource&lt;String, String&gt; source = KeyValueSource.fromMap( map ); Job&lt;String, String&gt; job = jobTracker.newJob( source ); JobCompletableFuture&lt;Map&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt; future = job .mapper( new TokenizerMapper() ) .combiner( new WordCountCombinerFactory() ) .reducer( new WordCountReducerFactory() ) .submit(); String jobId = future.getJobId(); TrackableJob trackableJob = jobTracker.getTrackableJob(jobId); JobProcessInformation stats = trackableJob.getJobProcessInformation(); int processedRecords = stats.getProcessedRecords(); log( &quot;ProcessedRecords: &quot; + processedRecords ); JobPartitionState[] partitionStates = stats.getPartitionStates(); for ( JobPartitionState partitionState : partitionStates ) { log( &quot;PartitionOwner: &quot; + partitionState.getOwner() + &quot;, Processing state: &quot; + partitionState.getState().name() ); } NOTE: Caching of the JobProcessInformation does not work on Java native clients since current values are retrieved while retrieving the instance to minimize traffic between executing member and client. Configuring JobTracker You configure JobTracker configuration to set up behavior of the Hazelcast MapReduce framework. Every JobTracker is capable of running multiple MapReduce jobs at once; one configuration is meant as a shared resource for all jobs created by the same JobTracker. The configuration gives full control over the expected load behavior and thread counts to be used. The following snippet shows a typical JobTracker configuration. The configuration properties are discussed below the example. &lt;jobtracker name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; &lt;max-thread-size&gt;0&lt;\/max-thread-size&gt; &lt;!-- Queue size 0 means number of partitions * 2 --&gt; &lt;queue-size&gt;0&lt;\/queue-size&gt; &lt;retry-count&gt;0&lt;\/retry-count&gt; &lt;chunk-size&gt;1000&lt;\/chunk-size&gt; &lt;communicate-stats&gt;true&lt;\/communicate-stats&gt; &lt;topology-changed-strategy&gt;CANCEL_RUNNING_OPERATION&lt;\/topology-changed-strategy&gt; &lt;\/jobtracker&gt; max-thread-size: Maximum thread pool size of the JobTracker. queue-size: Maximum number of tasks that are able to wait to be processed. A value of 0 means an unbounded queue. Very low numbers can prevent successful execution since the job might not be correctly scheduled or intermediate chunks might be lost. retry-count: Currently not used. Reserved for later use where the framework will automatically try to restart\/retry operations from an available save point. chunk-size: Number of emitted values before a chunk is sent to the reducers. If your emitted values are big or you want to better balance your work, you might want to change this to a lower or higher value. A value of 0 means immediate transmission, but remember that low values mean higher traffic costs. A very high value might cause an OutOfMemoryError to occur if the emitted values do not fit into heap memory before being sent to the reducers. To prevent this, you might want to use a combiner to pre-reduce values on mapping members. communicate-stats: Specifies whether the statistics (for example, statistics about processed entries) are transmitted to the job emitter. This can show progress to a user inside of an UI system, but it produces additional traffic. If not needed, you might want to deactivate this. topology-changed-strategy: Specifies how the MapReduce framework reacts on topology changes while executing a job. Currently, only CANCEL_RUNNING_OPERATION is fully supported, which throws an exception to the job emitter (will throw a com.hazelcast.mapreduce.TopologyChangedException).","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/MapReduce\/Using_the_MapReduce_API.html"},{"title":"Hazelcast MapReduce Architecture","text":"This section explains some of the internals of the MapReduce framework. This is more advanced information. If you're not interested in how it works internally, you might want to skip this section. Member Interoperation Example To understand the following technical internals, we first have a short look at what happens in terms of an example workflow. As a simple example, think of an IMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; and emitted keys having the same types. Imagine you have a cluster with three members, and you initiate the MapReduce job on the first member. After you requested the JobTracker from your running\/connected Hazelcast, we submit the task and retrieve the ICompletableFuture, which gives us a chance to wait for the result to be calculated or to add a callback (and being more reactive). The example expects that the chunk size is 0 or 1, so an emitted value is directly sent to the reducers. Internally, the job is prepared, started, and executed on all members as shown below. The first member acts as the job owner (job emitter). Member1 starts MapReduce job Member1 emits key=Foo, value=1 Member1 does PartitionService::getKeyOwner(Foo) =&gt; results in Member3 Member2 emits key=Foo, value=14 Member2 asks jobOwner (Member1) for keyOwner of Foo =&gt; results in Member3 Member1 sends chunk for key=Foo to Member3 Member3 receives chunk for key=Foo and looks if there is already a Reducer, if not creates one for key=Foo Member3 processes chunk for key=Foo Member2 sends chunk for key=Foo to Member3 Member3 receives chunk for key=Foo and looks if there is already a Reducer and uses the previous one Member3 processes chunk for key=Foo Member1 send LastChunk information to Member3 because processing local values finished Member2 emits key=Foo, value=27 Member2 has cached keyOwner of Foo =&gt; results in Member3 Member2 sends chunk for key=Foo to Member3 Member3 receives chunk for key=Foo and looks if there is already a Reducer and uses the previous one Member3 processes chunk for key=Foo Member2 send LastChunk information to Member3 because processing local values finished Member3 finishes reducing for key=Foo Member1 registers its local partitions are processed Member2 registers its local partitions are processed Member1 sees all partitions processed and requests reducing from all members Member1 merges all reduced results together in a final structure and returns it The flow is quite complex but extremely powerful since everything is executed in parallel. Reducers do not wait until all values are emitted, but they immediately begin to reduce (when the first chunk for an emitted key arrives). Internal MapReduce Packages Beginning with the package level, there is one basic package: com.hazelcast.mapreduce. This includes the external API and the impl package, which itself contains the internal implementation. The impl package contains all the default KeyValueSource implementations and abstract base and support classes for the exposed API. The client package contains all classes that are needed on the client and member sides when a client offers a MapReduce job. The notification package contains all &quot;notification&quot; or event classes that notify other members about progress on operations. The operation package contains all operations that are used by the workers or job owner to coordinate work and sync partition or reducer processing. The task package contains all classes that execute the actual MapReduce operation. It features the supervisor, mapping phase implementation, and mapping and reducing tasks. MapReduce Job Walk-Through Now to the technical walk-through: A MapReduce Job is always retrieved from a named JobTracker, which is implemented in NodeJobTracker (extends AbstractJobTracker) and is configured using the configuration DSL. All of the internal implementation is completely ICompletableFuture-driven and mostly non-blocking in design. On submit, the Job creates a unique UUID which afterwards acts as a jobId and is combined with the JobTracker's name to be uniquely identifiable inside the cluster. Then, the preparation is sent around the cluster and every member prepares its execution by creating a JobSupervisor, MapCombineTask, and ReducerTask. The job-emitting JobSupervisor gains special capabilities to synchronize and control JobSupervisors on other members for the same job. If preparation is finished on all members, the job itself is started by executing a StartProcessingJobOperation on every member. This initiates a MappingPhase implementation (defaults to KeyValueSourceMappingPhase) and starts the actual mapping on the members. The mapping process is currently a single threaded operation per member, but will be extended to run in parallel on multiple partitions (configurable per Job) in future versions. The Mapper is now called on every available value on the partition and eventually emits values. For every emitted value, either a configured CombinerFactory is called to create a Combiner or a cached one is used (or the default CollectingCombinerFactory is used to create Combiners). When the chunk limit is reached on a member, a IntermediateChunkNotification is prepared by collecting emitted keys to their corresponding members. This is either done by asking the job owner to assign members or by an already cached assignment. In later versions, a PartitionStrategy might also be configurable. The IntermediateChunkNotification is then sent to the reducers (containing only values for this member) and is offered to the ReducerTask. On every offer, the ReducerTask checks if it is already running and if not, it submits itself to the configured ExecutorService (from the JobTracker configuration). If reducer queue runs out of work, the ReducerTask is removed from the ExecutorService to not block threads but eventually will be resubmitted on next chunk of work. On every phase, the partition state is changed to keep track of the currently running operations. A JobPartitionState can be in one of the following states with self-explanatory titles: [WAITING, MAPPING, REDUCING, PROCESSED, CANCELLED]. If you have a deeper interest of these states, look at the Javadoc. Member asks for new partition to process: WAITING =&gt; MAPPING Member emits first chunk to a reducer: MAPPING =&gt; REDUCING All members signal that they finished mapping phase and reducing is finished, too: REDUCING =&gt; PROCESSED Eventually, all JobPartitionStates reach the state of PROCESSED. Then, the job emitter's JobSupervisor asks all members for their reduced results and executes a potentially offered Collator. With this Collator, the overall result is calculated before it removes itself from the JobTracker, doing some final cleanup and returning the result to the requester (using the internal TrackableJobFuture). If a job is cancelled while execution, all partitions are immediately set to the CANCELLED state and a CancelJobSupervisorOperation is executed on all members to kill the running processes. While the operation is running in addition to the default operations, some more operations like ProcessStatsUpdateOperation (updates processed records statistics) or NotifyRemoteExceptionOperation (notifies the members that the sending member encountered an unrecoverable situation and the Job needs to be cancelled, e.g., NullPointerException inside of a Mapper, are executed against the job owner to keep track of the process.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/MapReduce\/Hazelcast_MapReduce_Architecture.html"},{"title":"Aggregators","text":"NOTE: This feature has been deprecated. Please use the Fast-Aggregations instead. Based on the Hazelcast MapReduce framework, Aggregators are ready-to-use data aggregations. These are typical operations like sum up values, finding minimum or maximum values, calculating averages, and other operations that you would expect in the relational database world. Aggregation operations are implemented, as mentioned above, on top of the MapReduce framework, and all operations can be achieved using pure MapReduce calls. However, using the Aggregation feature is more convenient for a big set of standard operations.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/Aggregators\/index.html"},{"title":"Aggregations Basics","text":"This section will quickly guide you through the basics of the Aggregations framework and some of its available classes. We also will implement a first base example. Aggregations and Map Interfaces Aggregations are available on both types of map interfaces, com.hazelcast.core.IMap and com.hazelcast .core.MultiMap, using the aggregate methods. Two overloaded methods are available that customize resource management of the underlying MapReduce framework by supplying a custom configured com.hazelcast.mapreduce.JobTracker instance. To find out how to configure the MapReduce framework, please see the Configuring JobTracker. We will later see another way to configure the automatically used MapReduce framework if no special JobTracker is supplied. Aggregations and Java To make Aggregations more convenient to use and future proof, the API is heavily optimized for Java 8 and future versions. The API is still fully compatible with any Java version Hazelcast supports (Java 6 and Java 7). The biggest difference is how you work with the Java generics: on Java 6 and 7, the process to resolve generics is not as strong as on Java 8 and future Java versions. In addition, the whole Aggregations API has full Java 8 Project Lambda (or Closure, JSR 335) support. For illustration of the differences in Java 6 and 7 in comparison to Java 8, we will have a quick look at code examples for both. After that, we will focus on using Java 8 syntax to keep examples short and easy to understand, and we will see some hints about what the code looks like in Java 6 or 7. The first example will produce the sum of some int values stored in a Hazelcast IMap. This example does not use much of the functionality of the Aggregations framework, but it will show the main difference. IMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; personAgeMapping = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;person-age&quot; ); for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++ ) { String lastName = RandomUtil.randomLastName(); int age = RandomUtil.randomAgeBetween( 20, 80 ); personAgeMapping.put( lastName, Integer.valueOf( age ) ); } With our demo data prepared, we can see how to produce the sums in different Java versions. Aggregations and Java 6 or Java 7 Since Java 6 and 7 are not as strong on resolving generics as Java 8, you need to be a bit more verbose with the code you write. You might also consider using raw types but breaking the type safety to ease this process. For a short introduction on what the following code example means, look at the source code comments. We will later dig deeper into the different options. \/\/ No filter applied, select all entries Supplier&lt;String, Integer, Integer&gt; supplier = Supplier.all(); \/\/ Choose the sum aggregation Aggregation&lt;String, Integer, Integer&gt; aggregation = Aggregations.integerSum(); \/\/ Execute the aggregation int sum = personAgeMapping.aggregate( supplier, aggregation ); Aggregations and Java 8 With Java 8, the Aggregations API looks simpler because Java 8 can resolve the generic parameters for us. That means the above lines of Java 6\/7 example code will end up in just one easy line on Java 8. int sum = personAgeMapping.aggregate( Supplier.all(), Aggregations.integerSum() ); Aggregations and the MapReduce Framework As mentioned before, the Aggregations implementation is based on the Hazelcast MapReduce framework and therefore you might find overlaps in their APIs. One overload of the aggregate method can be supplied with a JobTracker, which is part of the MapReduce framework. If you implement your own aggregations, you will use a mixture of the Aggregations and the MapReduce API. If you do so, e.g., to make the life of colleagues easier, please read the Implementing Aggregations section. For the full MapReduce documentation please see the MapReduce section.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/Aggregators\/Aggregations_Basics.html"},{"title":"Using the Aggregations API","text":"We now look into what can be achieved using the Aggregations API. To work on some deeper examples, let's quickly have a look at the available classes and interfaces and discuss their usage. Supplier The com.hazelcast.mapreduce.aggregation.Supplier provides filtering and data extraction to the aggregation operation. This class already provides a few different static methods to achieve the most common cases. Supplier.all() accepts all incoming values and does not apply any data extraction or transformation upon them before supplying them to the aggregation function itself. For filtering data sets, you have two different options by default: You can either supply a com.hazelcast.query.Predicate if you want to filter on values and\/or keys, or You can supply a com.hazelcast.mapreduce.KeyPredicate if you can decide directly on the data key without the need to deserialize the value. As mentioned above, all APIs are fully Java 8 and Lambda compatible. Let's have a look on how we can do basic filtering using those two options. Basic Filtering with KeyPredicate First, we have a look at a KeyPredicate and we only accept people whose last name is &quot;Jones&quot;. Supplier&lt;...&gt; supplier = Supplier.fromKeyPredicate( lastName -&gt; &quot;Jones&quot;.equalsIgnoreCase( lastName ) ); class JonesKeyPredicate implements KeyPredicate&lt;String&gt; { public boolean evaluate( String key ) { return &quot;Jones&quot;.equalsIgnoreCase( key ); } } Filtering on Values with Predicate Using the standard Hazelcast Predicate interface, we can also filter based on the value of a data entry. In the following example, you can only select values that are divisible by 4 without a remainder. Supplier&lt;...&gt; supplier = Supplier.fromPredicate( entry -&gt; entry.getValue() % 4 == 0 ); class DivisiblePredicate implements Predicate&lt;String, Integer&gt; { public boolean apply( Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; entry ) { return entry.getValue() % 4 == 0; } } Extracting and Transforming Data As well as filtering, Supplier can also extract or transform data before providing it to the aggregation operation itself. The following example shows how to transform an input value to a string. Supplier&lt;String, Integer, String&gt; supplier = Supplier.all( value -&gt; Integer.toString(value) ); You can see a Java 6\/7 example in the Aggregations Examples section. Apart from the fact we transformed the input value of type int (or Integer) to a string, we can see that the generic information of the resulting Supplier has changed as well. This indicates that we now have an aggregation working on string values. Chaining Multiple Filtering Rules Another feature of Supplier is its ability to chain multiple filtering rules. Let's combine all of the above examples into one rule set: Supplier&lt;String, Integer, String&gt; supplier = Supplier.fromKeyPredicate( lastName -&gt; &quot;Jones&quot;.equalsIgnoreCase( lastName ), Supplier.fromPredicate( entry -&gt; entry.getValue() % 4 == 0, Supplier.all( value -&gt; Integer.toString(value) ) ) ); Implementing Supplier with Special Requirements You might prefer or need to implement your Supplier based on special requirements. This is a very basic task. The Supplier abstract class has just one method: the apply method. NOTE: Due to a limitation of the Java Lambda API, you cannot implement abstract classes using Lambdas. Instead it is recommended that you create a standard named class. class MyCustomSupplier extends Supplier&lt;String, Integer, String&gt; { public String apply( Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; entry ) { Integer value = entry.getValue(); if (value == null) { return null; } return value % 4 == 0 ? String.valueOf( value ) : null; } } The Supplier apply methods are expected to return null whenever the input value should not be mapped to the aggregation process. This can be used, as in the example above, to implement filter rules directly. Implementing filters using the KeyPredicate and Predicate interfaces might be more convenient. To use your own Supplier, just pass it to the aggregate method or use it in combination with other Suppliers. int sum = personAgeMapping.aggregate( new MyCustomSupplier(), Aggregations.count() ); Supplier&lt;String, Integer, String&gt; supplier = Supplier.fromKeyPredicate( lastName -&gt; &quot;Jones&quot;.equalsIgnoreCase( lastName ), new MyCustomSupplier() ); int sum = personAgeMapping.aggregate( supplier, Aggregations.count() ); Defining the Aggregation Operation The com.hazelcast.mapreduce.aggregation.Aggregation interface defines the aggregation operation itself. It contains a set of MapReduce API implementations like Mapper, Combiner, Reducer, and Collator. These implementations are normally unique to the chosen Aggregation. This interface can also be implemented with your aggregation operations based on MapReduce calls. For more information, refer to Implementing Aggregations section. The com.hazelcast.mapreduce.aggregation.Aggregations class provides a common predefined set of aggregations. This class contains type safe aggregations of the following types: Average (Integer, Long, Double, BigInteger, BigDecimal) Sum (Integer, Long, Double, BigInteger, BigDecimal) Min (Integer, Long, Double, BigInteger, BigDecimal, Comparable) Max (Integer, Long, Double, BigInteger, BigDecimal, Comparable) DistinctValues Count Those aggregations are similar to their counterparts on relational databases and can be equated to SQL statements as set out below. Average Calculates an average value based on all selected values. map.aggregate( Supplier.all( person -&gt; person.getAge() ), Aggregations.integerAvg() ); SELECT AVG(person.age) FROM person; Sum Calculates a sum based on all selected values. map.aggregate( Supplier.all( person -&gt; person.getAge() ), Aggregations.integerSum() ); SELECT SUM(person.age) FROM person; Minimum (Min) Finds the minimal value over all selected values. map.aggregate( Supplier.all( person -&gt; person.getAge() ), Aggregations.integerMin() ); SELECT MIN(person.age) FROM person; Maximum (Max) Finds the maximal value over all selected values. map.aggregate( Supplier.all( person -&gt; person.getAge() ), Aggregations.integerMax() ); SELECT MAX(person.age) FROM person; Distinct Values Returns a collection of distinct values over the selected values map.aggregate( Supplier.all( person -&gt; person.getAge() ), Aggregations.distinctValues() ); SELECT DISTINCT person.age FROM person; Count Returns the element count over all selected values map.aggregate( Supplier.all(), Aggregations.count() ); SELECT COUNT(*) FROM person; Extracting Attribute Values with PropertyExtractor We used the com.hazelcast.mapreduce.aggregation.PropertyExtractor interface before when we had a look at the example on how to use a Supplier to extract and transform data. It can also be used to extract attributes from values. class Person { private String firstName; private String lastName; private int age; \/\/ getters and setters } PropertyExtractor&lt;Person, Integer&gt; propertyExtractor = (person) -&gt; person.getAge(); class AgeExtractor implements PropertyExtractor&lt;Person, Integer&gt; { public Integer extract( Person value ) { return value.getAge(); } } In this example, we extract the value from the person's age attribute. The value type changes from Person to Integer which is reflected in the generics information to stay type safe. You can use PropertyExtractors for any kind of transformation of data. You might even want to have multiple transformation steps chained one after another. Configuring Aggregations As stated before, the easiest way to configure the resources used by the underlying MapReduce framework is to supply a JobTracker to the aggregation call itself by passing it to either IMap::aggregate or MultiMap::aggregate. There is another way to implicitly configure the underlying used JobTracker. If no specific JobTracker was passed for the aggregation call, internally one will be created using the following naming specifications: For IMap aggregation calls the naming specification is created as: hz::aggregation-map- and the concatenated name of the map. For MultiMap it is very similar: hz::aggregation-multimap- and the concatenated name of the MultiMap. Knowing the specification of the name, we can configure the JobTracker as expected (as described in Retrieving a JobTracker Instance) using the naming spec we just learned. For more information on configuration of the JobTracker, please see Configuring Jobtracker. To finish this section, let's have a quick example for the above naming specs: IMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; map = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;mymap&quot; ); \/\/ The internal JobTracker name resolves to 'hz::aggregation-map-mymap' map.aggregate( ... ); MultiMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; multimap = hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( &quot;mymultimap&quot; ); \/\/ The internal JobTracker name resolves to 'hz::aggregation-multimap-mymultimap' multimap.aggregate( ... );","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/Aggregators\/Using_the_Aggregations_API.html"},{"title":"Aggregations Examples","text":"For the final example, imagine you are working for an international company and you have an employee database stored in Hazelcast IMap with all employees worldwide and a MultiMap for assigning employees to their certain locations or offices. In addition, there is another IMap that holds the salary per employee. Setting up the Data Model Let's have a look at our data model. class Employee implements Serializable { private String firstName; private String lastName; private String companyName; private String address; private String city; private String county; private String state; private int zip; private String phone1; private String phone2; private String email; private String web; \/\/ getters and setters } class SalaryMonth implements Serializable { private Month month; private int salary; \/\/ getters and setters } class SalaryYear implements Serializable { private String email; private int year; private List&lt;SalaryMonth&gt; months; \/\/ getters and setters public int getAnnualSalary() { int sum = 0; for ( SalaryMonth salaryMonth : getMonths() ) { sum += salaryMonth.getSalary(); } return sum; } } The two IMaps and the MultiMap are keyed by the string of email. They are defined as follows: IMap&lt;String, Employee&gt; employees = hz.getMap( &quot;employees&quot; ); IMap&lt;String, SalaryYear&gt; salaries = hz.getMap( &quot;salaries&quot; ); MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; officeAssignment = hz.getMultiMap( &quot;office-employee&quot; ); So far, we know all the important information to work out some example aggregations. We will look into some deeper implementation details and how we can work around some current limitations that will be eliminated in future versions of the API. Average Aggregation Example Let's start with a very basic example. We want to know the average salary of all of our employees. To do this, we need a PropertyExtractor and the average aggregation for type Integer. IMap&lt;String, SalaryYear&gt; salaries = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;salaries&quot; ); PropertyExtractor&lt;SalaryYear, Integer&gt; extractor = (salaryYear) -&gt; salaryYear.getAnnualSalary(); int avgSalary = salaries.aggregate( Supplier.all( extractor ), Aggregations.integerAvg() ); That's it. Internally, we created a MapReduce task based on the predefined aggregation and fired it up immediately. Currently all aggregation calls are blocking operations, so it is not yet possible to execute the aggregation in a reactive way (using com.hazelcast.core.ICompletableFuture), but this will be part of an upcoming version. Map Join Example The following example is a little more complex. We only want to have our US-based employees selected into the average salary calculation, so we need to execute a join operation between the employees and salaries maps. class USEmployeeFilter implements KeyPredicate&lt;String&gt;, HazelcastInstanceAware { private transient HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance; public void setHazelcastInstance( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance ) { this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance; } public boolean evaluate( String email ) { IMap&lt;String, Employee&gt; employees = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;employees&quot; ); Employee employee = employees.get( email ); return &quot;US&quot;.equals( employee.getCountry() ); } } Using the HazelcastInstanceAware interface, we get the current instance of Hazelcast injected into our filter and we can perform data joins on other data structures of the cluster. We now only select employees that work as part of our US offices into the aggregation. IMap&lt;String, SalaryYear&gt; salaries = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;salaries&quot; ); PropertyExtractor&lt;SalaryYear, Integer&gt; extractor = (salaryYear) -&gt; salaryYear.getAnnualSalary(); int avgSalary = salaries.aggregate( Supplier.fromKeyPredicate( new USEmployeeFilter(), extractor ), Aggregations.integerAvg() ); Grouping Example For our next example, we will do some grouping based on the different worldwide offices. Currently, a group aggregator is not yet available, so we need a small workaround to achieve this goal. (In later versions of the Aggregations API this will not be required because it will be available out of the box in a much more convenient way.) Again, let's start with our filter. This time, we want to filter based on an office name and we need to do some data joins to achieve this kind of filtering. A short tip: to minimize the data transmission on the aggregation we can use Data Affinity rules to influence the partitioning of data. Be aware that this is an expert feature of Hazelcast. class OfficeEmployeeFilter implements KeyPredicate&lt;String&gt;, HazelcastInstanceAware { private transient HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance; private String office; \/\/ Deserialization Constructor public OfficeEmployeeFilter() { } public OfficeEmployeeFilter( String office ) { this.office = office; } public void setHazelcastInstance( HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance ) { this.hazelcastInstance = hazelcastInstance; } public boolean evaluate( String email ) { MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; officeAssignment = hazelcastInstance .getMultiMap( &quot;office-employee&quot; ); return officeAssignment.containsEntry( office, email ); } } Now we can execute our aggregations. As mentioned before, we currently need to do the grouping on our own by executing multiple aggregations in a row. Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; avgSalariesPerOffice = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;(); IMap&lt;String, SalaryYear&gt; salaries = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;salaries&quot; ); MultiMap&lt;String, String&gt; officeAssignment = hazelcastInstance.getMultiMap( &quot;office-employee&quot; ); PropertyExtractor&lt;SalaryYear, Integer&gt; extractor = (salaryYear) -&gt; salaryYear.getAnnualSalary(); for ( String office : officeAssignment.keySet() ) { OfficeEmployeeFilter filter = new OfficeEmployeeFilter( office ); int avgSalary = salaries.aggregate( Supplier.fromKeyPredicate( filter, extractor ), Aggregations.integerAvg() ); avgSalariesPerOffice.put( office, avgSalary ); } Simple Count Example We want to end this section by executing one final and easy aggregation. We want to know how many employees we currently have on a worldwide basis. Before reading the next lines of example code, you can try to do it on your own to see if you understood how to execute aggregations. IMap&lt;String, Employee&gt; employees = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;employees&quot; ); int count = employees.size(); Ok, after the quick joke of the previous two code lines, we look at the real two code lines: IMap&lt;String, Employee&gt; employees = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;employees&quot; ); int count = employees.aggregate( Supplier.all(), Aggregations.count() ); We now have an overview of how to use aggregations in real life situations. If you want to do your colleagues a favor, you might want to write your own additional set of aggregations. If so, then read the next section, Implementing Aggregations.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/Aggregators\/Aggregations_Examples.html"},{"title":"Implementing Aggregations","text":"This section explains how to implement your own aggregations in your own application. It is an advanced section, so if you do not intend to implement your own aggregation, you might want to stop reading here and come back later when you need to know how to implement your own aggregation. An Aggregation implementation is defining a MapReduce task, but with a small difference: the Mapper is always expected to work on a Supplier that filters and\/or transforms the mapped input value to some output value. Aggregation Methods The main interface for making your own aggregation is com.hazelcast.mapreduce.aggregation.Aggregation. It consists of four methods. interface Aggregation&lt;Key, Supplied, Result&gt; { Mapper getMapper(Supplier&lt;Key, ?, Supplied&gt; supplier); CombinerFactory getCombinerFactory(); ReducerFactory getReducerFactory(); Collator&lt;Map.Entry, Result&gt; getCollator(); } The getMapper and getReducerFactory methods should return non-null values. getCombinerFactory and getCollator are optional operations and you do not need to implement them. You can decide to implement them depending on the use case you want to achieve. Aggregation Tips For more information on how you implement mappers, combiners, reducers, and collators, refer to the MapReduce section. For best speed and traffic usage, as mentioned in the MapReduce section, you should add a Combiner to your aggregation whenever it is possible to do some kind of pre-reduction step.

There are also two callbacks: onAccumulationFinished() called when the accumulation phase finishes. onCombinationFinished() called when the combination phase finishes. These callbacks enable releasing the state that might have been initialized and stored in the Aggregator - to reduce the network traffic. Each phase is described below. Accumulation During the accumulation phase each Aggregator accumulates all entries passed to it by the query engine. It accumulates only those pieces of information that are required to calculate the aggregation result in the last phase - that's implementation specific. In case of the DoubleAverage aggregation the Aggregator would accumulate: the sum of the elements it accumulated the count of the elements it accumulated Combination Since Fast-Aggregation is executed in parallel on each partition of the cluster, the results need to be combined after the accumulation phase in order to be able to calculate the final result. In case of the DoubleAverage aggregation, the aggregator would sum up all the sums of the elements and all the counts. Aggregation Aggregation is the last phase that calculates the final result from the results accumulated and combined in the preceding phases. In case of the DoubleAverage aggregation, the Aggregator would just divide the sum of the elements by their count (if non-zero).

After the construction of a continuous query cache, all changes on the underlying IMap are immediately reflected to this cache as a stream of events. Therefore, this cache will be an always up-to-date view of the IMap. You can create a continuous query cache either on the client or member. Keeping Query Results Local and Ready A continuous query cache is beneficial when you need to query the distributed IMap data in a very frequent and fast way. By using a continuous query cache, the result of the query will always be ready and local to the application. Accessing Continuous Query Cache from Member The following code snippet shows how you can access a continuous query cache from a member. QueryCacheConfig queryCacheConfig = new QueryCacheConfig(&quot;cache-name&quot;); queryCacheConfig.getPredicateConfig().setImplementation(new OddKeysPredicate()); MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig(&quot;map-name&quot;); mapConfig.addQueryCacheConfig(queryCacheConfig); Config config = new Config(); config.addMapConfig(mapConfig); HazelcastInstance node = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); IEnterpriseMap&lt;Integer, String&gt; map = (IEnterpriseMap) node.getMap(&quot;map-name&quot;); QueryCache&lt;Integer, String&gt; cache = map.getQueryCache(&quot;cache-name&quot;); Accessing Continuous Query Cache from Client Side The following code snippet shows how you can access a continuous query cache from the client side. The difference in this code from the member side code above is that you configure and instantiate a client instance instead of a member instance. QueryCacheConfig queryCacheConfig = new QueryCacheConfig(&quot;cache-name&quot;); queryCacheConfig.getPredicateConfig().setImplementation(new OddKeysPredicate()); ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); clientConfig.addQueryCacheConfig(&quot;map-name&quot;, queryCacheConfig); HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig); IEnterpriseMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; clientMap = (IEnterpriseMap) client.getMap(&quot;map-name&quot;); QueryCache&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; cache = clientMap.getQueryCache(&quot;cache-name&quot;); Features of Continuous Query Cache The following features of continuous query cache are valid for both the member and client. The initial query that is run on the existing IMap data during the continuous query cache construction can be enabled\/disabled according to the supplied predicate via QueryCacheConfig#setPopulate. Continuous query cache allows you to run queries with indexes, and perform event batching and coalescing. A continuous query cache is evictable. Note that a continuous query cache has a default maximum capacity of 10000. If you need a non-evictable cache, you should configure the eviction via QueryCacheConfig#setEvictionConfig. A listener can be added to a continuous query cache using QueryCache#addEntryListener. IMap events are reflected in continuous query cache in the same order as they were generated on map entries. Since events are created on entries stored in partitions, ordering of events is maintained based on the ordering within the partition. You can add listeners to capture lost events using EventLostListener and you can recover lost events with the method QueryCache#tryRecover. Recovery of lost events largely depends on the size of the buffer on Hazelcast members. Default buffer size is 16 per partition; i.e. 16 events per partition can be maintained in the buffer. If the event generation is high, setting the buffer size to a higher number will provide better chances of recovering lost events. You can set buffer size with QueryCacheConfig#setBufferSize. You can use the following example code for a recovery case. QueryCache queryCache = map.getQueryCache(&quot;cache-name&quot;, new SqlPredicate(&quot;this &gt; 20&quot;), true); queryCache.addEntryListener(new EventLostListener() { @Override public void eventLost(EventLostEvent event) { queryCache.tryRecover(); } }, false); You can configure continuous query cache declaratively or programmatically. You can populate a continuous query cache with only the keys of its entries and retrieve the subsequent values directly via QueryCache#get from the underlying IMap. This helps to decrease the initial population time when the values are very large.","tags":"","url":"Distributed_Query\/Continuous_Query_Cache.html"},{"title":"Transactions","text":"This chapter explains the usage of Hazelcast in a transactional context. It describes the Hazelcast transaction types and how they work, how to provide XA (eXtended Architeture) transactions, and how to integrate Hazelcast with J2EE containers.","tags":"","url":"Transactions\/index.html"},{"title":"Creating a Transaction Interface","text":"You create a TransactionContext object to begin, commit, and rollback a transaction. You can obtain transaction-aware instances of queues, maps, sets, lists, multimaps via TransactionContext, work with them, and commit\/rollback in one shot. You can see the TransactionContext source code here. Hazelcast supports two types of transactions: ONE_PHASE and TWO_PHASE. The type of transaction controls what happens when a member crashes while a transaction is committing. The default behavior is TWO_PHASE. NOTE: Starting with Hazelcast 3.6, the transaction type LOCAL has been deprecated. Please use ONE_PHASE for the Hazelcast releases 3.6 and higher. ONE_PHASE: By selecting this transaction type, you execute the transactions with a single phase that is committing the changes. Since a preparing phase does not exist, the conflicts are not detected. When a conflict happens while committing the changes, e.g., due to a member crash, not all the changes are written and this leaves the system in an inconsistent state. TWO_PHASE: When you select this transaction type, Hazelcast first tries to execute the prepare phase. This phase fails if there are any conflicts. Once the prepare phase is successful, Hazelcast executes the commit phase (writing the changes). Before TWO_PHASE commits, Hazelcast copies the commit log to other members, so in case of a member failure, another member can complete the commit. import java.util.Queue; import java.util.Map; import java.util.Set; import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.Transaction; HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); TransactionOptions options = new TransactionOptions() .setTransactionType( TransactionType.ONE_PHASE ); TransactionContext context = hazelcastInstance.newTransactionContext( options ); context.beginTransaction(); TransactionalQueue queue = context.getQueue( &quot;myqueue&quot; ); TransactionalMap map = context.getMap( &quot;mymap&quot; ); TransactionalSet set = context.getSet( &quot;myset&quot; ); try { Object obj = queue.poll(); \/\/process obj map.put( &quot;1&quot;, &quot;value1&quot; ); set.add( &quot;value&quot; ); \/\/do other things.. context.commitTransaction(); } catch ( Throwable t ) { context.rollbackTransaction(); } In a transaction, operations will not be executed immediately. Their changes will be local to the TransactionContext until committed. However, they will ensure the changes via locks. For the above example, when map.put is executed, no data will be put in the map but the key will be locked against changes. While committing, operations will be executed, the value will be put to the map, and the key will be unlocked. The isolation level in Hazelcast Transactions is READ_COMMITTED. If you are in a transaction, you can read the data in your transaction and the data that is already committed. If you are not in a transaction, you can only read the committed data. NOTE: The REPEATABLE_READ isolation level can also be exercised using the method getForUpdate() of TransactionalMap. Queue\/Set\/List vs. Map\/Multimap Hazelcast implements queue\/set\/list operations differently than map\/multimap operations. For queue operations (offer, poll), offered and\/or polled objects are copied to the owner member in order to safely commit\/rollback. For map\/multimap, Hazelcast first acquires the locks for the write operations (put, remove) and holds the differences (what is added\/removed\/updated) locally for each transaction. When the transaction is set to commit, Hazelcast will release the locks and apply the differences. When rolling back, Hazelcast will release the locks and discard the differences. MapStore and QueueStore do not participate in transactions. Hazelcast will suppress exceptions thrown by the store in a transaction. Please refer to the XA Transactions section for further information. ONE_PHASE vs. TWO_PHASE As discussed in the introduction paragraph, when you choose ONE_PHASE as the transaction type, Hazelcast tracks all changes you make locally in a commit log, i.e., a list of changes. In this case, all the other members are asked to agree that the commit can succeed and once they agree, Hazelcast starts to write the changes. However, if the member that initiates the commit crashes after it has written to at least one member (but has not completed writing to all other members), your system may be left in an inconsistent state. On the other hand, if you choose TWO_PHASE as the transaction type, the commit log is again tracked locally but it is copied to another cluster member. Therefore, when a failure happens, e.g., the member initiating the commit crashes, you still have the commit log in another member and that member can complete the commit. However, copying the commit log to another member makes the TWO_PHASE approach slow. Consequently, it is recommended that you choose ONE_PHASE as the transaction type if you want better performance, and that you choose TWO_PHASE if reliability of your system is more important than the performance.","tags":"","url":"Transactions\/Creating_a_Transaction_Interface.html"},{"title":"Providing XA Transactions","text":"XA describes the interface between the global transaction manager and the local resource manager. XA allows multiple resources (such as databases, application servers, message queues, transactional caches, etc.) to be accessed within the same transaction, thereby preserving the ACID properties across applications.

When you implement the XAResource interface, Hazelcast provides XA transactions. You can obtain the HazelcastXAResource instance via the HazelcastInstance getXAResource method. You can see the HazelcastXAResource source code here. Below is example code that uses Atomikos for transaction management.

The Hazelcast JCache implementation is 100% TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) compliant and therefore passes all specification requirements. In addition to the given specification, we added some features like asynchronous versions of almost all operations to give the user extra power. This chapter gives a basic understanding of how to configure your application and how to setup Hazelcast to be your JCache provider. It also shows examples of basic JCache usage as well as the additionally offered features that are not part of JSR-107.

This API is the bridge between the specified JCache standard and the implementation provided by Hazelcast. The method of integrating the JCache API JAR into the application classpath depends on the build system used. For Maven, Gradle, SBT, Ivy, and many other build systems, all using Maven-based dependency repositories, perform the integration by adding the Maven coordinates to the build descriptor. As already mentioned, you have to add JCache coordinates next to the default Hazelcast coordinates that might be already part of the application. For Maven users, the coordinates look like the following code: &lt;dependency&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;javax.cache&lt;\/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;cache-api&lt;\/artifactId&gt; &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;\/version&gt; &lt;\/dependency&gt; With other build systems, you might need to describe the coordinates in a different way. Activating Hazelcast as JCache Provider To activate Hazelcast as the JCache provider implementation, add either hazelcast-all.jar or hazelcast.jar to the classpath (if not already available) by either one of the following Maven snippets. If you use hazelcast-all.jar: &lt;dependency&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;com.hazelcast&lt;\/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;hazelcast-all&lt;\/artifactId&gt; &lt;version&gt;&quot;your Hazelcast version, e.g. 3.7&quot;&lt;\/version&gt; &lt;\/dependency&gt; If you use hazelcast.jar: &lt;dependency&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;com.hazelcast&lt;\/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;hazelcast&lt;\/artifactId&gt; &lt;version&gt;&quot;your Hazelcast version, e.g. 3.7&quot;&lt;\/version&gt; &lt;\/dependency&gt; The users of other build systems have to adjust the definition of the dependency to their needs. Connecting Clients to Remote Member When the users want to use Hazelcast clients to connect to a remote cluster, the hazelcast-client.jar dependency is also required on the client side applications. This JAR is already included in hazelcast-all.jar. Or, you can add it to the classpath using the following Maven snippet: &lt;dependency&gt; &lt;groupId&gt;com.hazelcast&lt;\/groupId&gt; &lt;artifactId&gt;hazelcast-client&lt;\/artifactId&gt; &lt;version&gt;&quot;your Hazelcast version, e.g. 3.7&quot;&lt;\/version&gt; &lt;\/dependency&gt; For other build systems, for instance, ANT, the users have to download these dependencies from either the JSR-107 specification and Hazelcast community website (http:\/\/www.hazelcast.org) or from the Maven repository search page (http:\/\/search.maven.org).","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_JCache\/Setup_and_Configuration\/Setting_your_Application.html"},{"title":"Example JCache Application","text":"Before moving on to configuration, let's have a look at a basic introductory example.

Getting the Hazelcast JCache Implementation First of all, we retrieve the javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider using the static method from javax.cache.Caching:: getCachingManager, which automatically picks up Hazelcast as the underlying JCache implementation, if available in the classpath. This way, the Hazelcast implementation of a CachingProvider will automatically start a new Hazelcast member or client (depending on the chosen provider type) and pick up the configuration from either the command line parameter or from the classpath. We will show how to use an existing HazelcastInstance later in this chapter; for now, we keep it simple. Setting up the JCache Entry Point In the next line, we ask the CachingProvider to return a javax.cache.CacheManager. This is the general application's entry point into JCache. The CachingProvider creates and manages named caches. Configuring the Cache Before Creating It The next few lines create a simple javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration to configure the cache before actually creating it. In this case, we only configure the key and value types to make the cache typesafe which is highly recommended and checked on retrieval of the cache. Creating the Cache To create the cache, we call javax.cache.CacheManager::createCache with a name for the cache and the previously created configuration; the call returns the created cache. If you need to retrieve a previously created cache, you can use the corresponding method overload javax.cache.CacheManager::getCache. If the cache was created using type parameters, you must retrieve the cache afterward using the type checking version of getCache. get, put, and getAndPut The following lines are simple put and get calls from the java.util.Map interface. The javax.cache.Cache::put has a void return type and does not return the previously assigned value of the key. To imitate the java.util.Map::put method, the JCache cache has a method called getAndPut.","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_JCache\/Setup_and_Configuration\/Example_JCache_Application.html"},{"title":"Configuring for JCache","text":"Hazelcast JCache provides for two different methods of cache configuration: programmatically: the typical Hazelcast way, using the Config API seen above, and declaratively: using hazelcast.xml or hazelcast-client.xml.

Using this declarative configuration makes creating the javax.cache.Cache fully transparent and automatically ensures internal thread safety. You do not need a call to javax.cache.Cache::createCache in this case: you can retrieve the cache using javax.cache.Cache::getCache overloads and by passing in the name defined in the configuration for the cache. To retrieve the cache that you defined in the declaration files, you need only perform a simple call (example below) because the cache is created automatically by the implementation.

Hazelcast implements a delegating CachingProvider that can automatically be configured for either client or member mode and that delegates to the real underlying implementation based on the user's choice. Hazelcast recommends that you use this CachingProvider implementation. The delegating CachingProviders fully qualified class name is com.hazelcast.cache.HazelcastCachingProvider To configure the delegating provider at the command line, add the following parameter to the Java startup call, depending on the chosen provider: -Dhazelcast.jcache.provider.type=[client|server] By default, the delegating CachingProvider is automatically picked up by the JCache SPI and provided as shown above. In cases where multiple javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider implementations reside on the classpath (like in some Application Server scenarios), you can select a CachingProvider by explicitly calling Caching::getCachingProvider overloads and providing them using the canonical class name of the provider to be used. The class names of member and client providers provided by Hazelcast are mentioned in the following two subsections. NOTE: Hazelcast advises that you use the Caching::getCachingProvider overloads to select a CachingProvider explicitly.

The database layer will be simulated using single demo data in a simple DAO interface. To show the difference between the &quot;database&quot; access and retrieving values from the cache, a small waiting time is used in the DAO implementation to simulate network and database latency. Creating User Class Example Before we implement the JCache caching layer, let's have a quick look at some basic classes we need for this example. The User class is the representation of a user table in the database. To keep it simple, it has just two properties: userId and username. public class User { private int userId; private String username; \/\/ Getters and setters } Creating DAO Interface Example The DAO interface is also kept easy in this example. It provides a simple method to retrieve (find) a user by its userId. public interface UserDAO { User findUserById( int userId ); boolean storeUser( int userId, User user ); boolean removeUser( int userId ); Collection&lt;Integer&gt; allUserIds(); } Configuring JCache Example To show most of the standard features, the configuration example is a little more complex. \/\/ Create javax.cache.configuration.CompleteConfiguration subclass CompleteConfiguration&lt;Integer, User&gt; config = new MutableConfiguration&lt;Integer, User&gt;() \/\/ Configure the cache to be typesafe .setTypes( Integer.class, User.class ) \/\/ Configure to expire entries 30 secs after creation in the cache .setExpiryPolicyFactory( FactoryBuilder.factoryOf( new AccessedExpiryPolicy( new Duration( TimeUnit.SECONDS, 30 ) ) ) ) \/\/ Configure read-through of the underlying store .setReadThrough( true ) \/\/ Configure write-through to the underlying store .setWriteThrough( true ) \/\/ Configure the javax.cache.integration.CacheLoader .setCacheLoaderFactory( FactoryBuilder.factoryOf( new UserCacheLoader( userDao ) ) ) \/\/ Configure the javax.cache.integration.CacheWriter .setCacheWriterFactory( FactoryBuilder.factoryOf( new UserCacheWriter( userDao ) ) ) \/\/ Configure the javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener with no \/\/ javax.cache.event.CacheEntryEventFilter, to include old value \/\/ and to be executed synchronously .addCacheEntryListenerConfiguration( new MutableCacheEntryListenerConfiguration&lt;Integer, User&gt;( new UserCacheEntryListenerFactory(), null, true, true ) ); Let's go through this configuration line by line. Setting the Cache Type and Expire Policy First, we set the expected types for the cache, which is already known from the previous example. On the next line, a javax.cache.expiry.ExpirePolicy is configured. Almost all integration ExpirePolicy implementations are configured using javax.cache.configuration.Factory instances. Factory and FactoryBuilder are explained later in this chapter. Configuring Read-Through and Write-Through The next two lines configure the thread that will be read-through and write-through to the underlying backend resource that is configured over the next few lines. The JCache API offers javax.cache.integration.CacheLoader and javax.cache.integration.CacheWriter to implement adapter classes to any kind of backend resource, e.g., JPA, JDBC, or any other backend technology implementable in Java. The interface provides the typical CRUD operations like create, get, update, delete, and some bulk operation versions of those common operations. We will look into the implementation of those implementations later. Configuring Entry Listeners The last configuration setting defines entry listeners based on sub-interfaces of javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener. This config does not use a javax.cache.event.CacheEntryEventFilter since the listener is meant to be fired on every change that happens on the cache. Again we will look in the implementation of the listener in later in this chapter.

The following are quick descriptions of them: javax.cache.Caching: The access point into the JCache API. It retrieves the general CachingProvider backed by any compliant JCache implementation, such as Hazelcast JCache. javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider: The SPI that is implemented to bridge between the JCache API and the implementation itself. Hazelcast members and clients use different providers chosen as seen in the Configuring JCache Provider section which enable the JCache API to interact with Hazelcast clusters. When a javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider::getCacheManager overload is used that takes a java.lang.ClassLoader argument, this classloader will be part of the scope of the created java.cache.Cache and it is not possible to retrieve it on other members. We advise not to use those overloads, as they are not meant to be used in distributed environments! javax.cache.CacheManager: The CacheManager provides the capability to create new and manage existing JCache caches. NOTE: A javax.cache.Cache instance created with key and value types in the configuration provides a type checking of those types at retrieval of the cache. For that reason, all non-types retrieval methods like getCache throw an exception because types cannot be checked. javax.cache.configuration.Configuration, javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration: These two classes are used to configure a cache prior to retrieving it from a CacheManager. The Configuration interface, therefore, acts as a common super type for all compatible configuration classes such as MutableConfiguration. Hazelcast itself offers a special implementation (com.hazelcast.config.CacheConfig) of the Configuration interface which offers more options on the specific Hazelcast properties that can be set to configure features like synchronous and asynchronous backups counts or selecting the underlying In Memory Format of the cache. For more information on this configuration class, please see the reference in JCache Programmatic Configuration section. javax.cache.Cache: This interface represents the cache instance itself. It is comparable to java.util.Map but offers special operations dedicated to the caching use case. Therefore, for example javax.cache.Cache::put, unlike java.util.Map::put, does not return the old value previously assigned to the given key. NOTE: Bulk operations on the Cache interface guarantee atomicity per entry but not over all given keys in the same bulk operations since no transactional behavior is applied over the whole batch process.","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_JCache\/JCache_API\/JCache_Base_Classes.html"},{"title":"Implementing Factory and FactoryBuilder","text":"The javax.cache.configuration.Factory implementations configure features like CacheEntryListener, ExpirePolicy, and CacheLoaders or CacheWriters. These factory implementations are required to distribute the different features to members in a cluster environment like Hazelcast. Therefore, these factory implementations have to be serializable. Factory implementations are easy to do, as they follow the default Provider- or Factory-Pattern. The sample class UserCacheEntryListenerFactory shown below implements a custom JCache Factory. public class UserCacheEntryListenerFactory implements Factory&lt;CacheEntryListener&lt;Integer, User&gt;&gt; { @Override public CacheEntryListener&lt;Integer, User&gt; create() { \/\/ Just create a new listener instance return new UserCacheEntryListener(); } } To simplify the process for the users, JCache API offers a set of helper methods collected in javax.cache. configuration.FactoryBuilder.

Cache read-through If the cache is configured to be read-through, then CacheLoader::load is called transparently from the cache when the key or the value is not yet found in the cache. If no value is found for a given key, it returns null. If the cache is not configured to be read-through, nothing is loaded automatically. The user code must call javax.cache.Cache::loadAll to load data for the given set of keys into the cache. For the bulk load operation (loadAll()), some keys may not be found in the returned result set. In this case, a javax.cache.integration.CompletionListener parameter can be used as an asynchronous callback after all the key-value pairs are loaded because loading many key-value pairs can take lots of time. CacheLoader Example Let's look at the UserCacheLoader implementation. This implementation is quite straight forward. It implements CacheLoader. It overrides the load method to compute or retrieve the value corresponding to key. It overrides the loadAll method to compute or retrieve the values corresponding to keys. An important note is that any kind of exception has to be wrapped into javax.cache.integration.CacheLoaderException. public class UserCacheLoader implements CacheLoader&lt;Integer, User&gt;, Serializable { private final UserDao userDao; public UserCacheLoader( UserDao userDao ) { \/\/ Store the dao instance created externally this.userDao = userDao; } @Override public User load( Integer key ) throws CacheLoaderException { \/\/ Just call through into the dao return userDao.findUserById( key ); } @Override public Map&lt;Integer, User&gt; loadAll( Iterable&lt;? extends Integer&gt; keys ) throws CacheLoaderException { \/\/ Create the resulting map Map&lt;Integer, User&gt; loaded = new HashMap&lt;Integer, User&gt;(); \/\/ For every key in the given set of keys for ( Integer key : keys ) { \/\/ Try to retrieve the user User user = userDao.findUserById( key ); \/\/ If user is not found do not add the key to the result set if ( user != null ) { loaded.put( key, user ); } } return loaded; } }","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_JCache\/JCache_API\/Implementing_CacheLoader.html"},{"title":"Implementing CacheWriter","text":"You use a javax.cache.integration.CacheWriter to update an external backend resource. If the cache is configured to be write-through, this process is executed transparently to the user's code. Otherwise, there is currently no way to trigger writing changed entries to the external resource to a user-defined point in time. If bulk operations throw an exception, java.util.Collection has to be cleaned of all successfully written keys so the cache implementation can determine what keys are written and can be applied to the cache state. The following example performs the following tasks: It implements CacheWriter. It overrides the write method to write the specified entry to the underlying store. It overrides the writeAll method to write the specified entires to the underlying store. It overrides the delete method to delete the key entry from the store. It overrides the deleteAll method to delete the data and keys from the underlying store for the given collection of keys, if present. public class UserCacheWriter implements CacheWriter&lt;Integer, User&gt;, Serializable { private final UserDao userDao; public UserCacheWriter( UserDao userDao ) { \/\/ Store the dao instance created externally this.userDao = userDao; } @Override public void write( Cache.Entry&lt;? extends Integer, ? extends User&gt; entry ) throws CacheWriterException { \/\/ Store the user using the dao userDao.storeUser( entry.getKey(), entry.getValue() ); } @Override public void writeAll( Collection&lt;Cache.Entry&lt;...&gt;&gt; entries ) throws CacheWriterException { \/\/ Retrieve the iterator to clean up the collection from \/\/ written keys in case of an exception Iterator&lt;Cache.Entry&lt;...&gt;&gt; iterator = entries.iterator(); while ( iterator.hasNext() ) { \/\/ Write entry using dao write( iterator.next() ); \/\/ Remove from collection of keys iterator.remove(); } } @Override public void delete( Object key ) throws CacheWriterException { \/\/ Test for key type if ( !( key instanceof Integer ) ) { throw new CacheWriterException( &quot;Illegal key type&quot; ); } \/\/ Remove user using dao userDao.removeUser( ( Integer ) key ); } @Override public void deleteAll( Collection&lt;?&gt; keys ) throws CacheWriterException { \/\/ Retrieve the iterator to clean up the collection from \/\/ written keys in case of an exception Iterator&lt;?&gt; iterator = keys.iterator(); while ( iterator.hasNext() ) { \/\/ Write entry using dao delete( iterator.next() ); \/\/ Remove from collection of keys iterator.remove(); } } } Again, the implementation is pretty straightforward and also as above all exceptions thrown by the external resource, like java.sql.SQLException has to be wrapped into a javax.cache.integration.CacheWriterException.

In a distributed environment like Hazelcast, you can move the mutating function to the member that owns the key. If the value object is big, it might prevent traffic by sending the object to the mutator and sending it back to the owner to update it. By default, Hazelcast JCache sends the complete changed value to the backup partition. Again, this can cause a lot of traffic if the object is big. The Hazelcast ICache extension can also prevent this. Further information is available at Implementing BackupAwareEntryProcessor. An arbitrary number of arguments can be passed to the Cache::invoke and Cache::invokeAll methods. All of those arguments need to be fully serializable because in a distributed environment like Hazelcast, it is very likely that these arguments have to be passed around the cluster. The following example performs the following tasks. It implements EntryProcessor. It overrides the process method to process an entry. public class UserUpdateEntryProcessor implements EntryProcessor&lt;Integer, User, User&gt; { @Override public User process( MutableEntry&lt;Integer, User&gt; entry, Object... arguments ) throws EntryProcessorException { \/\/ Test arguments length if ( arguments.length &lt; 1 ) { throw new EntryProcessorException( &quot;One argument needed: username&quot; ); } \/\/ Get first argument and test for String type Object argument = arguments[0]; if ( !( argument instanceof String ) ) { throw new EntryProcessorException( &quot;First argument has wrong type, required java.lang.String&quot; ); } \/\/ Retrieve the value from the MutableEntry User user = entry.getValue(); \/\/ Retrieve the new username from the first argument String newUsername = ( String ) arguments[0]; \/\/ Set the new username user.setUsername( newUsername ); \/\/ Set the changed user to mark the entry as dirty entry.setValue( user ); \/\/ Return the changed user to return it to the caller return user; } } NOTE: By executing the bulk Cache::invokeAll operation, atomicity is only guaranteed for a single cache entry. No transactional rules are applied to the bulk operation. NOTE: JCache EntryProcessor implementations are not allowed to call javax.cache.Cache methods. This prevents operations from deadlocking between different calls. In addition, when using a Cache::invokeAll method, a java.util.Map is returned that maps the key to its javax.cache.processor.EntryProcessorResult, which itself wraps the actual result or a thrown javax.cache.processor.EntryProcessorException.","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_JCache\/JCache_API\/Implementing_Entry_Processor.html"},{"title":"Implementing CacheEntryListener","text":"The javax.cache.event.CacheEntryListener implementation is straight forward.

A value of zero (or Duration.ZERO) indicates that the cache entry expires immediately. By default, JCache delivers a set of predefined expiry strategies in the standard API.

In the case of an embedded member, you can scope a CacheManager to join different clusters at the same time. This process is called scoping. To apply scoping, request a CacheManager by passing a java.net.URI instance to CachingProvider::getCacheManager. The java.net.URI instance must point to either a Hazelcast configuration or to the name of a named com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance instance. NOTE: Multiple requests for the same java.net.URI result in returning a CacheManager instance that shares the same HazelcastInstance as the CacheManager returned by the previous call. Applying Configuration Scope To connect or join different clusters, apply a configuration scope to the CacheManager. If the same URI is used to request a CacheManager that was created previously, those CacheManagers share the same underlying HazelcastInstance. To apply a configuration scope, pass in the path of the configuration file using the location property HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION (which resolves to hazelcast.config.location) as a mapping inside a java.util.Properties instance to the CachingProvider#getCacheManager(uri, classLoader, properties) call. Here is an example of using Configuration Scope. CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider(); \/\/ Create Properties instance pointing to a Hazelcast config file Properties properties = new Properties(); properties.setProperty( HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION, &quot;classpath:\/\/my-configs\/scoped-hazelcast.xml&quot; ); URI cacheManagerName = new URI( &quot;my-cache-manager&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties ); Here is an example using HazelcastCachingProvider::propertiesByLocation helper method. CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider(); \/\/ Create Properties instance pointing to a Hazelcast config file String configFile = &quot;classpath:\/\/my-configs\/scoped-hazelcast.xml&quot;; Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider .propertiesByLocation( configFile ); URI cacheManagerName = new URI( &quot;my-cache-manager&quot; ); CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider .getCacheManager( cacheManagerName, null, properties ); The retrieved CacheManager is scoped to use the HazelcastInstance that was just created and was configured using the given XML configuration file. Available protocols for config file URL include classpath:\/\/ to point to a classpath location, file:\/\/ to point to a filesystem location, http:\/\/ an https:\/\/ for remote web locations. In addition, everything that does not specify a protocol is recognized as a placeholder that can be configured using a system property. String configFile = &quot;my-placeholder&quot;; Properties properties = HazelcastCachingProvider .propertiesByLocation( configFile ); You can set this on the command line. -Dmy-placeholder=classpath:\/\/my-configs\/scoped-hazelcast.xml You should consider the following rules about the Hazelcast instance name when you specify the configuration file location using HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION (which resolves to hazelcast.config.location): If you also specified the HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME (which resolves to hazelcast.instance.name) property, this property is used as the instance name even though you configured the instance name in the configuration file. If you do not specify HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME but you configure the instance name in the configuration file using the element &lt;instance-name&gt;, this element's value will be used as the instance name. If you do not specify an instance name via property or in the configuration file, the URL of the configuration file location is used as the instance name. NOTE: No check is performed to prevent creating multiple CacheManagers with the same cluster configuration on different configuration files. If the same cluster is referred from different configuration files, multiple cluster members or clients are created. NOTE: The configuration file location will not be a part of the resulting identity of the CacheManager. An attempt to create a CacheManager with a different set of properties but an already used name will result in undefined behavior. Binding to a Named Instance You can bind CacheManager to an existing and named HazelcastInstance instance. If the instanceName is specified in com.hazelcast.config.Config, it can be used directly by passing it to CachingProvider implementation. Otherwise (instanceName not set or instance is a client instance) you must get the instance name from the HazelcastInstance instance via the String getName() method to pass the CachingProvider implementation. Please note that instanceName is not configurable for the client side HazelcastInstance instance and is auto-generated by using group name (if it is specified). In general, String getName() method over HazelcastInstance is safer and the preferable way to get the name of the instance. Multiple CacheManagers created using an equal java.net.URI will share the same HazelcastInstance. A named scope is applied nearly the same way as the configuration scope: pass in the instance name using the HazelcastCachingProvider#HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME (which resolves to hazelcast.instance.name) property as a mapping inside a java.util.Properties instance to the CachingProvider#getCacheManager(uri, classLoader, properties) call. Here is an example of Named Instance Scope with specified name.

Implementing an expiry policy is one way you can prevent infinite growth, but sometimes it is hard to define a meaningful expiration timeout. Therefore, Hazelcast JCache provides the eviction feature. Eviction offers the possibility of removing entries based on the cache size or amount of used memory (Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Only) and not based on timeouts. Eviction and Runtime Since a cache is designed for high throughput and fast reads, Hazelcast put a lot of effort into designing the eviction system to be as predictable as possible. All built-in implementations provide an amortized O(1) runtime. The default operation runtime is rendered as O(1), but it can be faster than the normal runtime cost if the algorithm finds an expired entry while sampling. Cache Types Most importantly, typical production systems have two common types of caches: Reference Caches: Caches for reference data are normally small and are used to speed up the de-referencing as a lookup table. Those caches are commonly tend to be small and contain a previously known, fixed number of elements, e.g., states of the USA or abbreviations of elements. Active DataSet Caches: The other type of caches normally caches an active data set. These caches run to their maximum size and evict the oldest or not frequently used entries to keep in memory bounds. They sit in front of a database or HTML generators to cache the latest requested data. Hazelcast JCache eviction supports both types of caches using a slightly different approach based on the configured maximum size of the cache. For detailed information, please see the Eviction Algorithm section below. Configuring Eviction Policies Hazelcast JCache provides two commonly known eviction policies, LRU and LFU, but loosens the rules for predictable runtime behavior. LRU, normally recognized as Least Recently Used, is implemented as Less Recently Used, and LFU known as Least Frequently Used is implemented as Less Frequently Used. The details about this difference are explained in the Eviction Algorithm section. Eviction Policies are configured by providing the corresponding abbreviation to the configuration as shown in the ICache Configuration section. As already mentioned, two built-in policies are available: To configure the use of the LRU (Less Recently Used) policy: &lt;eviction size=&quot;10000&quot; max-size-policy=&quot;ENTRY_COUNT&quot; eviction-policy=&quot;LRU&quot; \/&gt; And to configure the use of the LFU (Less Frequently Used) policy: &lt;eviction size=&quot;10000&quot; max-size-policy=&quot;ENTRY_COUNT&quot; eviction-policy=&quot;LFU&quot; \/&gt; The default eviction policy is LRU. Therefore, Hazelcast JCache does not offer the possibility of performing no eviction. Custom Eviction Policies Besides out of the box eviction policies LFU and LRU, you can also specify your custom eviction policies through the eviction configuration either programmatically or declaratively. You can provide your com.hazelcast.cache.CacheEvictionPolicyComparator implementation to compare com.hazelcast.cache.CacheEntryViews. Supplied CacheEvictionPolicyComparator is used to compare cache entry views to select the one with higher priority to evict. Here is an example for custom eviction policy comparator implementation for JCache: public class MyCacheEvictionPolicyComparator extends CacheEvictionPolicyComparator&lt;Long, String&gt; { @Override public int compare(CacheEntryView&lt;Long, String&gt; e1, CacheEntryView&lt;Long, String&gt; e2) { long id1 = e1.getKey(); long id2 = e2.getKey(); if (id1 &gt; id2) { return FIRST_ENTRY_HAS_HIGHER_PRIORITY_TO_BE_EVICTED; \/\/ -1 } else if (id1 &lt; id2) { return SECOND_ENTRY_HAS_HIGHER_PRIORITY_TO_BE_EVICTED; \/\/ +1 } else { return BOTH_OF_ENTRIES_HAVE_SAME_PRIORITY_TO_BE_EVICTED; \/\/ 0 } } } Configuration Custom eviction policy comparator can be specified through the eviction configuration by giving the full class name of the EvictionPolicyComparator (CacheEvictionPolicyComparator for JCache and its near cache) implementation or by specifying its instance itself. Programmatic: You can specify the full class name of custom EvictionPolicyComparator (CacheEvictionPolicyComparator for JCache and its near cache) implementation through EvictionConfig. This approach is useful when eviction configuration is specified at the client side and custom EvictionPolicyComparator implementation class itself does not exist at the client but at server side. CacheConfig cacheConfig = new CacheConfig(); ... EvictionConfig evictionConfig = new EvictionConfig(50000, MaxSizePolicy.ENTRY_COUNT, &quot;com.mycompany.MyEvictionPolicyComparator&quot;); cacheConfig.setEvictionConfig(evictionConfig); You can specify the custom EvictionPolicyComparator (CacheEvictionPolicyComparator for JCache and its near cache) instance itself directly through EvictionConfig. CacheConfig cacheConfig = new CacheConfig(); ... EvictionConfig evictionConfig = new EvictionConfig(50000, MaxSizePolicy.ENTRY_COUNT, new MyEvictionPolicyComparator()); cacheConfig.setEvictionConfig(evictionConfig); Declarative: You can specify the full class name of custom EvictionPolicyComparator (CacheEvictionPolicyComparator for JCache and its near cache) implementation in the &lt;eviction&gt; tag through comparator-class-name attribute in Hazelcast configuration XML file. &lt;cache name=&quot;cacheWithCustomEvictionPolicyComparator&quot;&gt; &lt;eviction size=&quot;50000&quot; max-size-policy=&quot;ENTRY_COUNT&quot; comparator-class-name=&quot;com.mycompany.MyEvictionPolicyComparator&quot;\/&gt; &lt;\/cache&gt; Declarative for Spring: You can specify the full class name of custom EvictionPolicyComparator (CacheEvictionPolicyComparator for JCache and its near cache) implementation in the &lt;eviction&gt; tag through comparator-class-name attribute in Hazelcast Spring configuration XML file. &lt;hz:cache name=&quot;cacheWithCustomEvictionPolicyComparator&quot;&gt; &lt;hz:eviction size=&quot;50000&quot; max-size-policy=&quot;ENTRY_COUNT&quot; comparator-class-name=&quot;com.mycompany.MyEvictionPolicyComparator&quot;\/&gt; &lt;\/hz:cache&gt; You can specify the custom EvictionPolicyComparator (CacheEvictionPolicyComparator for JCache and its near cache) bean in the &lt;eviction&gt; tag by referencing through comparator-bean attribute in Hazelcast Spring configuration XML file &lt;hz:cache name=&quot;cacheWithCustomEvictionPolicyComparator&quot;&gt; &lt;hz:eviction size=&quot;50000&quot; max-size-policy=&quot;ENTRY_COUNT&quot; comparator-bean=&quot;myEvictionPolicyComparatorBean&quot;\/&gt; &lt;\/hz:cache&gt; Eviction Strategy Eviction strategies implement the logic of selecting one or more eviction candidates from the underlying storage implementation and passing them to the eviction policies. Hazelcast JCache provides an amortized O(1) cost implementation for this strategy to select a fixed number of samples from the current partition that it is executed against. The default implementation is com.hazelcast.cache.impl.eviction.impl.strategy.sampling.SamplingBasedEvictionStrategy which, as mentioned, samples 15 random elements. A detailed description of the algorithm will be explained in the next section. Eviction Algorithm The Hazelcast JCache eviction algorithm is specially designed for the use case of high performance caches and with predictability in mind. The built-in implementations provide an amortized O(1) runtime and therefore provide a highly predictable runtime behavior which does not rely on any kind of background threads to handle the eviction. Therefore, the algorithm takes some assumptions into account to prevent network operations and concurrent accesses. As an explanation of how the algorithm works, let's examine the following flowchart step by step. A new cache is created. Without any special settings, the eviction is configured to kick in when the cache exceeds 10.000 elements and an LRU (Less Recently Used) policy is set up. The user puts in a new entry, e.g., a key-value pair. For every put, the eviction strategy evaluates the current cache size and decides if an eviction is necessary or not. If not, the entry is stored in step 10. If eviction is required, a new sampling is started. The built-in sampler is implemented as an lazy iterator. The sampling algorithm selects a random sample from the underlying data storage. The eviction strategy tests whether the sampled entry is already expired (lazy expiration). If expired, the sampling stops and the entry is removed in step 9. If not yet expired, the entry (eviction candidate) is compared to the last best matching candidate (based on the eviction policy) and the new best matching candidate is remembered. The sampling is repeated 15 times and then the best matching eviction candidate is returned to the eviction strategy. The expired or best matching eviction candidate is removed from the underlying data storage. The new put entry is stored. The put operation returns to the user. As seen in the flowchart, the general eviction operation is easy. As long as the cache does not reach its maximum capacity, or you execute updates (put\/replace), no eviction is executed. To prevent network operations and concurrent access, as mentioned earlier, the cache size is estimated based on the size of the currently handled partition. Due to the imbalanced partitions, the single partitions might start to evict earlier than the other partitions. As mentioned in the Cache Types section above, typically two types of caches are found in the production systems. For small caches, referred to as Reference Caches, the eviction algorithm has a special set of rules depending on the maximum configured cache size. Please see the Reference Caches section below for details. The other type of cache is referred to as an Active DataSet Cache, which in most cases makes heavy use of the eviction to keep the most active data set in the memory. Those kinds of caches use a very simple but efficient way to estimate the cluster-wide cache size. All of the following calculations have a well known set of fixed variables: GlobalCapacity: User defined maximum cache size (cluster-wide). PartitionCount: Number of partitions in the cluster (defaults to 271). BalancedPartitionSize: Number of elements in a balanced partition state, BalancedPartitionSize := GlobalCapacity \/ PartitionCount. Deviation: An approximated standard deviation (tests proofed it to be pretty near), Deviation := sqrt(BalancedPartitionSize). Reference Caches A Reference Cache is typically small and the number of elements to store in the reference caches is normally known prior to creating the cache. Typical examples of reference caches are lookup tables for abbreviations or the states of a country. They tend to have a fixed but small element number and the eviction is an unlikely event, and rather undesirable behavior. Since an imbalanced partition is a worse problem in small and mid-sized caches than in caches with millions of entries, the normal estimation rule (as discussed in a bit) is not applied to these kinds of caches. To prevent unwanted eviction on the small and mid-sized caches, Hazelcast implements a special set of rules to estimate the cluster size. To adjust the imbalance of partitions as found in the typical runtime, the actual calculated maximum cache size (known as the eviction threshold) is slightly higher than the user defined size. That means more elements can be stored into the cache than expected by the user. This needs to be taken into account especially for large objects, since those can easily exceed the expected memory consumption! Small caches: If a cache is configured with no more than 4.000 elements, this cache is considered to be a small cache. The actual partition size is derived from the number of elements (GlobalCapacity) and the deviation using the following formula: MaxPartitionSize := Deviation * 5 + BalancedPartitionSize This formula ends up with big partition sizes which, summed up, exceed the expected maximum cache size (set by the user). Since the small caches typically have a well known maximum number of elements, this is not a big issue. Only if the small caches are used for a use case other than as a reference cache, this needs to be taken into account. Mid-sized caches A mid-sized cache is defined as a cache with a maximum number of elements that is bigger than 4.000 but not bigger than 1.000.000 elements. The calculation of mid-sized caches is similar to that of the small caches but with a different multiplier. To calculate the maximum number of elements per partition, the following formula is used: MaxPartitionSize := Deviation * 3 + BalancedPartitionSize Active DataSet Caches For large caches, where the maximum cache size is bigger than 1.000.000 elements, there is no additional calculation needed. The maximum partition size is considered to be equal to BalancedPartitionSize since statistically big partitions are expected to almost balance themselves. Therefore, the formula is as easy as the following: MaxPartitionSize := BalancedPartitionSize Cache Size Estimation As mentioned earlier, Hazelcast JCache provides an estimation algorithm to prevent cluster-wide network operations, concurrent access to other partitions and background tasks. It also offers a highly predictable operation runtime when the eviction is necessary. The estimation algorithm is based on the previously calculated maximum partition size (please see the Reference Caches and Active DataSet Caches sections above) and is calculated against the current partition only. The algorithm to reckon the number of stored entries in the cache (cluster-wide) and decide if the eviction is necessary is shown in the following pseudo-code example: RequiresEviction[Boolean] := CurrentPartitionSize &gt;= MaxPartitionSize","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_JCache\/Hazelcast_JCache_Extension-ICache\/JCache_Eviction.html"},{"title":"JCache Near Cache","text":"The Hazelcast JCache implementation supports a local Near Cache for remotely stored entries to increase the performance of local read operations.

This allows you to create or pass another EntryProcessor to run on backup partitions and apply delta changes to the backup entries.

NOTE: Split-Brain is only supported for heap-based JCache but not for HD-JCache, since merging a high volume of data in consistent way may cause significant performance loss on the system. CacheMergePolicy Interface After split clusters are joined again, they merge their entries with each other. This merge process is handled over the CacheMergePolicy interface. The CacheMergePolicy instance takes two entries: the owned entry, and the merging entry which comes from the joined cluster. The CacheEntryView instance wraps the key, value, and some metadata about the entry (such as creation time, expiration time, and access hit). Then the CacheMergePolicy instance selects one of the entries and returns it. The returned entry is used as the stored cache entry. CacheEntryView Wraps key, value and some metadata (such as expiration time, last access time, and access hit of cache entry) and exposes them to outside as read only. CacheMergePolicy Policy for merging cache entries. Entries from joined clusters are merged by using this policy to select one of them from source and target. Passed CacheEntryView instances wrap the key and value as their original types, with conversion to object from their storage types.

StorageTypeAwareCacheMergePolicy Marker interface indicating that the key and value wrapped by CacheEntryView will be not converted to their original types. The motivation of this interface is that while merging cache entries, actual key and value are not usually not checked. Therefore, there is no need to convert them to their original types. At worst case, value is returned from the merge method as selected, meaning that in all cases, value is accessed. So even if the the conversion is done as lazy, it will be processed at this point. By default, key and value are converted to their original types unless this StorageTypeAwareCacheMergePolicy is used. Another motivation for using this interface is that at the member side, there is no need to locate classes of stored entries. Entries can be put from the client with BINARY in-memory format and the classpath of the client can be different from the member. So in this case, if entries try to convert to their original types while merging, ClassNotFoundException is thrown here. As a result, both for performance and for the ClassNotFoundException mentioned above, it is strongly recommended that you use this interface if the original values of key and values are not needed. Configuration There are four built-in cache merge policies: Pass Through: Merges cache entry from source to destination directly. You can specify this policy with its full class name as com.hazelcast.cache.merge.PassThroughCacheMergePolicy or with its constant name as PASS_THROUGH. Put If Absent: Merges cache entry from source to destination if it does not exist in the destination cache. You can specify this policy with its full class name as com.hazelcast.cache.merge.PutIfAbsentCacheMergePolicy or with its constant name as PUT_IF_ABSENT. Higher Hits: Merges cache entry from source to destination cache if the source entry has more hits than the destination one. You can specify this policy with its full class name as com.hazelcast.cache.merge.HigherHitsCacheMergePolicy or with its constant name as HIGHER_HITS. Latest Access: Merges cache entry from source to destination cache if the source entry has been accessed more recently than the destination entry. You can specify this policy with its full class name as com.hazelcast.cache.merge.LatestAccessCacheMergePolicy or with its constant name as LATEST_ACCESS. You can access full class names or constant names of all built-in cache merge policies over com.hazelcast.cache.BuiltInCacheMergePolicies enum. You can specify merge policy configuration for cache declaratively or programmatically. The following are example configurations for JCache Split-Brain. Declarative: &lt;cache name=&quot;cacheWithBuiltInMergePolicyAsConstantName&quot;&gt; ... &lt;merge-policy&gt;HIGHER_HITS&lt;\/merge-policy&gt; ... &lt;\/cache&gt;&lt;cache name=&quot;cacheWithBuiltInMergePolicyAsFullClassName&quot;&gt; ... &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.hazelcast.cache.merge.LatestAccessCacheMergePolicy&lt;\/merge-policy&gt; ... &lt;\/cache&gt; &lt;cache name=&quot;cacheWithBuiltInMergePolicyAsCustomImpl&quot;&gt; ... &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.mycompany.cache.merge.MyCacheMergePolicy&lt;\/merge-policy&gt; ... &lt;\/cache&gt; Programmatic: CacheConfig cacheConfigWithBuiltInMergePolicyAsConstantName = new CacheConfig(); cacheConfig.setMergePolicy(BuiltInCacheMergePolicies.HIGGER_HITS.name()); CacheConfig cacheConfigWithBuiltInMergePolicyAsFullClassName = new CacheConfig(); cacheConfig.setMergePolicy(BuiltInCacheMergePolicies.LATEST_ACCESS.getImplementationClassName()); CacheConfig cacheConfigWithBuiltInMergePolicyAsCustomImpl = new CacheConfig(); cacheConfig.setMergePolicy(&quot;com.mycompany.cache.merge.MyCacheMergePolicy&quot;);","tags":"","url":"Hazelcast_JCache\/Hazelcast_JCache_Extension-ICache\/JCache_Split-Brain.html"},{"title":"Testing for JCache Specification Compliance","text":"Hazelcast JCache is fully compliant with the JSR 107 TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit),and therefore is officially a JCache implementation.

Modern hardware has much more available memory. If you want to make use of that hardware and scale up by specifying higher heap sizes, GC becomes an increasing problem: the application faces long GC pauses that make the application unresponsive. Also, you may get out of memory errors if you fill your whole heap. Garbage collection, which is the automatic process that manages application\u00e2\u0080\u0099s runtime memory, often forces you into configurations where multiple JVMs with small heaps (sizes of 2-4GB per member) run on a single physical hardware device to avoid garbage collection pauses. This results in oversized clusters to hold the data and leads to performance level requirements. In Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD, the High-Density Memory Store is Hazelcast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new enterprise in-memory storage solution. It solves garbage collection limitations so that applications can exploit hardware memory more efficiently without the need of oversized clusters. High-Density Memory Store is designed as a pluggable memory manager which enables multiple memory stores for different data structures. These memory stores are all accessible by a common access layer that scales up to terabytes of the main memory on a single JVM by minimizing the GC pressure. High-Density Memory Store enables predictable application scaling and boosts performance and latency while minimizing garbage collection pauses. This foundation includes, but is not limited to, storing keys and values next to the heap in a native memory region.

Also, you can configure its size, memory allocator type, minimum block size, page size and metadata space percentage. size: Size of the total native memory to allocate. Default value is 512 MB. allocator type: Type of the memory allocator. Available values are as follows: STANDARD: This option is used internally by Hazelcast's POOLED allocator type or for debugging\/testing purposes. With this option, the memory is allocated or deallocated using your operating system's default memory manager. It uses GNU C Library's standard malloc() and free() methods which are subject to contention on multithreaded\/multicore systems. Memory operations may become slower when you perform a lot of small allocations and deallocations. It may cause large memory fragmentations, unless you use a method in the background that emphasizes fragmentation avoidance, such as jemalloc(). Note that a large memory fragmentation can trigger the Linux Out of Memory Killer if there is no swap space enabled in your system. Even if the swap space is enabled, the killer can be again triggered if there is not enough swap space left. If you still want to use the operating system's default memory management, you can set the allocator type to STANDARD in your native memory configuration. POOLED: This is the default option, Hazelcast's own pooling memory allocator. With this option, memory blocks are managed using internal memory pools. It allocates memory blocks, each of which has a 4MB page size by default, and splits them into chunks or merges them to create larger chunks when required. Sizing of these chunks follows the buddy memory allocation algorithm, i.e. power-of-two sizing. It never frees memory blocks back to the operating system. It marks disposed memory blocks as available to be used later, meaning that these blocks are reusable. Memory allocation and deallocation operations (except the ones requiring larger sizes than the page size) do not interact with the operating system mostly. For memory allocation, it tries to find the requested memory size inside the internal memory pools. If it cannot be found, then it interacts with the operating system. minimum block size: Minimum size of the blocks in bytes to split and fragment a page block to assign to an allocation request. It is used only by the POOLED memory allocator. Default value is 16. page size: Size of the page in bytes to allocate memory as a block. It is used only by the POOLED memory allocator. Default value is 1 &lt;&lt; 22 = 4194304 Bytes, about 4 MB. metadata space percentage: Defines the percentage of the allocated native memory that is used for internal memory structures by the High-Density Memory for tracking the used and available memory blocks.

If you use, for example, two backups, then the total memory footprint is three times the active data (active data + backup data + backup data). If you use only heap memory, each Hazelcast member with a 4 GB heap should accommodate a maximum of 3.5 GB of total data (active and backup). If you use the High-Density Memory Store, up to 75% of the configured physical memory footprint may be used for active and backup data, with headroom of 25% for normal memory fragmentation. In both cases, however, you should also keep some memory headroom available to handle any member failure or explicit member shutdown.

Hot Restart Persistence provides fast cluster restarts by storing the states of the cluster members on the disk. This feature is currently provided for the Hazelcast map data structure and the Hazelcast JCache implementation. Hot Restart Persistence Overview Hot Restart Persistence enables you to get your cluster up and running swiftly after a cluster restart. A restart can be caused by a planned shutdown (including rolling upgrades) or a sudden cluster-wide crash, e.g., power outage. For Hot Restart Persistence, required states for Hazelcast clusters and members are introduced. Please refer to the Managing Cluster and Member States section for information on the cluster and member states. The purpose of the Hot Restart Persistence is to provide a maintenance window for member operations and restart the cluster in a fast way. It is not meant to recover the catastrophic shutdown of one member.","tags":"","url":"Storage\/Hot_Restart_Persistence\/index.html"},{"title":"Hot Restart Types","text":"The Hot Restart feature is supported for the following restart types: Restart after a planned shutdown: The cluster is shut down completely and restarted with the exact same previous setup and data. You can shut down the cluster completely using the method HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown() or you can manually change the cluster state to PASSIVE and then shut down each member one by one. When you send the command to shut the cluster down, i.e. HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown(), the members that are not in the PASSIVE state temporarily change their states to PASSIVE. Then, each member shuts itself down by calling the method HazelcastInstance.shutdown(). Difference between explicitly changing state to PASSIVE before shutdown and shutting down cluster directly via HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown() is, on latter case when cluster is restarted, cluster state will be in the latest state before shutdown. That means if cluster is ACTIVE before shutdown, cluster state will automatically become ACTIVE after restart is completed. Rolling upgrade: The cluster is restarted intentionally member by member. For example, this could be done to install an operating system patch or new hardware. To be able to shut down the cluster member by member as part of a planned restart, each member in the cluster should be in the FROZEN or PASSIVE state. After the cluster state is changed to FROZEN or PASSIVE, you can manually shut down each member by calling the method HazelcastInstance.shutdown(). When that member is restarted, it will rejoin the running cluster. After all members are restarted, the cluster state can be changed back to ACTIVE. Restart after a cluster crash: The cluster is restarted after all its members crashed at the same time due to a power outage, networking interruptions, etc.","tags":"","url":"Storage\/Hot_Restart_Persistence\/Hot_Restart_Types.html"},{"title":"Restart Process","text":"During the restart process, each member waits to load data until all the members in the partition table are started. During this process, no operations are allowed. Once all cluster members are started, Hazelcast changes the cluster state to PASSIVE and starts to load data. When all data is loaded, Hazelcast changes the cluster state to its previous known state before shutdown and starts to accept the operations which are allowed by the restored cluster state. If a member fails to either start, join the cluster in time (within the timeout), or load its data, then that member will be terminated immediately. After the problems causing the failure are fixed, that member can be restarted. If the cluster start cannot be completed in time, then all members will fail to start. Please refer to the Configuring Hot Restart section for defining timeouts. In the case of a restart after a cluster crash, the Hot Restart feature realizes that it was not a clean shutdown and Hazelcast tries to restart the cluster with the last saved data following the process explained above. In some cases, specifically when the cluster crashes while it has an ongoing partition migration process, currently it is not possible to restore the last saved state. Example Scenarios Assume the following: You have a cluster consisting of members A and B with Hot Restart enabled, which is initially stable. Member B is killed. Member B restarts. Since only a single member has failed, the cluster performed the standard High Availability routine by recovering member B's data from backups and redistributing the data among the remaining members (the single member A in this case). Member B's persisted Hot Restart data is completely irrelevant. Furthermore, when a member starts with existing Hot Restart data, it expects to find itself within a cluster that has been shut down as a whole and is now restarting as a whole. Since the reality is that the cluster has been running all along, member B's persisted cluster state does not match the actual state. Therefore, member B aborts initialization and shuts down. As another scenario, assume the following: You have a cluster consisting of members A and B with Hot Restart enabled, which is initially stable. Member B is killed. Member B's Hot Restart base directory(base-dir) is deleted. Member B restarts. Now member B joins the cluster as a fresh, empty member. The cluster will assign some partitions to it, unrelated to the partitions it owned before going down.","tags":"","url":"Storage\/Hot_Restart_Persistence\/Restart_Process.html"},{"title":"Force Start","text":"A member can crash permanently and then be unable to recover from the failure. In that case, restart process cannot be completed since some of the members do not start or fail to load their own data. In that case, you can force the cluster to clean its persisted data and make a fresh start. This process is called force start. Assume the following which is a valid scenario to use force start: You have a cluster consisting of members A and B which is initially stable. Cluster transitions into FROZEN or PASSIVE state. Cluster gracefully shuts down. Member A restarts, but member B does not. Member A uses its Hot Restart data to initiate the Hot Restart procedure. Since it knows the cluster originally contained member B as well, it waits for it to join. This never happens. Now you have the choice to Force Start the cluster without member B. Cluster discards all Hot Restart data and starts empty. You can trigger the force start process using the Management Center, REST API and cluster management scripts. Please note that force start is a destructive process, which results in deletion of persisted Hot Restart data. Please refer to the Hot Restart functionality of the Management Center section to learn how you can perform a force start using the Management Center.","tags":"","url":"Storage\/Hot_Restart_Persistence\/Force_Start.html"},{"title":"Partial Start","text":"Partial Start When one or more members fail to start or have incorrect Hot Restart data (stale or corrupted data) or fail to load their Hot Restart data, cluster will become incomplete and restart mechanism cannot proceed. One solution is to use Force Start and make a fresh start with existing members. Another solution is to do a partial start. Partial start means that the cluster will start with an incomplete member set. Data belonging to those missing members will be assumed lost and Hazelcast will try to recover missing data using the restored backups. For example, if you have minimum two backups configured for all maps and caches, then a partial start up to two missing members will be safe against data loss. If there are more than two missing members or there are maps\/caches with less than two backups, then data loss is expected. Partial start is controlled by cluster-data-recovery-policy configuration parameter and is not allowed by default. To enable partial start, one of the configuration values PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_RECENT or PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_COMPLETE should be set. Please see Configuring Hot Restart section for details. When partial start is enabled, Hazelcast can perform a partial start automatically or manually, in case of some members are unable to restart successfully. Partial start proceeds automatically when some members fail to start and join to the cluster in validation-timeout-seconds. After the validation-timeout-seconds duration is passed, Hot Restart chooses to perform partial start with the members present in the cluster. Moreover, partial start can be requested manually using the Management Center, REST API and cluster management scripts before the validation-timeout-seconds duration passes. The other situation to decide to perform a partial start is failures during the data load phase. When Hazelcast learns data load result of all members which have passed the validation step, it automatically performs a partial start with the ones which have successfully restored their Hot Restart data. Please note that partial start does not expect every member to succeed in the data load step. It completes the process when it learns data load result for every member and there is at least one member which has successfully restored its Hot Restart data. Relatedly, if it cannot learn data load result of all members before data-load-timeout-seconds duration, it proceeds with the ones which have already completed the data load process. Selection of members to perform partial start among live members is done according to the cluster-data-recovery-policy configuration. Set of members which are not selected by the cluster-data-recovery-policy are called Excluded members, and they are instructed to perform force start. Excluded members are allowed to join cluster only when they clean their Hot Restart data and make a fresh-new start. This is a completely automatic process. For instance, if you start the missing members after partial start is completed, they clean their Hot Restart data and join to the cluster. Please note that partial start is a destructive process. Once it is completed, it cannot be repeated with a new configuration. For this reason, one may need to perform the partial start process manually. Automatic behavior of partial start relies on validation-timeout-seconds and data-load-timeout-seconds configuration values. If you need to control the process manually, validation-timeout-seconds and data-load-timeout-seconds properties can be set to very big values so that Hazelcast cannot make progress on timeouts automatically. Then, the overall process can be managed manually via aforementioned methods, i.e. Management Center, REST API and cluster management scripts.","tags":"","url":"Storage\/Hot_Restart_Persistence\/Partial_Start.html"},{"title":"Configuring Hot Restart","text":"You can configure Hot Restart programmatically or declaratively. The configuration includes elements to enable\/disable the feature, to specify the directory where the Hot Restart data will be stored, and to define timeout values. The following are the descriptions of the Hot Restart configuration elements. hot-restart-persistence: The configuration that enables the Hot Restart feature. It includes the element base-dir that is used to specify the directory where the Hot Restart data will be stored. The default value for base-dir is hot-restart. You can use the default value, or you can specify the value of another folder containing the Hot Restart configuration, but it is mandatory that this hot-restart element has a value. This directory will be created automatically if it does not exist. A single base-dir can be used only and only by a single Hazelcast member, it cannot be shared by multiple members. An attempt to use the same base-dir by multiple members will make these members abort the startup process except one which wins the ownership of the directory. parallelism: Level of parallelism in Hot Restart Persistence. There will be this many IO threads, each writing in parallel to its own files. During the Hot Restart procedure, this many IO threads will be reading the files and this many rebuilder threads will be rebuilding the Hot Restart metadata. validation-timeout-seconds: Validation timeout for the Hot Restart process when validating the cluster members expected to join and the partition table on the whole cluster. data-load-timeout-seconds: Data load timeout for the Hot Restart process. All members in the cluster should finish restoring their local data before this timeout. cluster-data-recovery-policy: Specifies the data recovery policy that will be respected during Hot Restart cluster start. Valid values are; FULL_RECOVERY_ONLY: Starts the cluster only when all expected members are present and correct. Otherwise, it fails. This is the default value. PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_RECENT: Starts the cluster with the members which have most up-to-date partition table and successfully restored their data. All other members will leave the cluster and force start themselves. If no member restores its data successfully, cluster start fails. PARTIAL_RECOVERY_MOST_COMPLETE: Starts the cluster with the largest group of members which have the same partition table version and successfully restored their data. All other members will leave the cluster and force start themselves. If no member restores its data successfully, cluster start fails. hot-restart: The configuration that enables or disables the Hot Restart feature per data structure. This element is used for the supported data structures (in the above examples, you can see that it is included in map and cache). Turning on fsync guarantees that data is persisted to the disk device when a write operation returns successful response to the caller. By default, fsync is turned off. That means data will be persisted to the disk device eventually, instead of on every disk write. This generally provides better performance.

Also it is possible to startup whole cluster on a different set of machines. ability to copy production data to test environment, so that a more functional test cluster can bet setup Unfortunately having different number of CPU cores is not that straightforward. Hazelcast partition threads, by default, will use a heuristic from the number of cores, e.g., # of partition threads = # of CPU cores. When Hazelcast member is started on a server with a different CPU core count, number of Hazelcast partition threads will change and that will make Hot Restart fail during startup.

The following is a top-level design description: The only kind of update operation on persistent data is appending. What is appended are facts about events that happened to the data model represented by the store; either a new value was assigned to a key or a key was removed. Each record associated with a key makes stale the previous record that was associated with that key. Stale records contribute to the amount of garbage present in the persistent storage. Measures are taken to remove garbage from the storage. This kind of design focuses almost all of the system's complexity into the garbage collection (GC) process, stripping down the client's operation to the bare necessity of guaranteeing persistent behavior: a simple file append operation. Consequently, the latency of operations is close to the theoretical minimum in almost all cases. Complications arise only during prolonged periods of maximum load; this is where the details of the GC process begin to matter.","tags":"","url":"Storage\/Hot_Restart_Persistence\/Design_Details.html"},{"title":"Concurrent-Incremental-Generational GC","text":"In order to maintain the lowest possible footprint in the update operation latency, the following properties are built into the garbage collection process: A dedicated thread performs the GC. In Hazelcast terms, this thread is called the Collector and the application thread is called the Mutator. On each update there is metadata to be maintained; this is done asynchronously by the Collector thread. The Mutator enqueues update events to the Collector's work queue. The Collector keeps draining its work queue at all times, including the time it goes through the GC cycle. Updates are taken into account at each stage in the GC cycle, preventing the copying of already dead records into compacted files. All GC-induced I\/O competes for the same resources as the Mutator's update operations. Therefore, measures are taken to minimize the impact of I\/O done during GC: data is never read from files, but from RAM; a heuristic scheme is employed which minimizes the number of bytes written to disk for each kilobyte of reclaimed garbage; measures are also taken to achieve a good interleaving of Collector and Mutator operations, minimizing latency outliers perceived by the Mutator. I\/O Minimization Scheme The success of this scheme is subject to a bet on the Weak Generational Garbage Hypothesis, which states that a new record entering the system is likely to become garbage soon. In other words, a key updated now is more likely than average to be updated again soon. The scheme was taken from the seminal Sprite LFS paper, Rosenblum, Ousterhout, The Design and Implementation of a Log-Structured File System. The following is an outline of the paper: Data is not written to one huge file, but to many files of moderate size (8 MB) called &quot;chunks&quot;. Garbage is collected incrementally, i.e. by choosing several chunks, then copying all their live data to new chunks, then deleting the old ones. I\/O is minimized using a collection technique which results in a bimodal distribution of chunks with respect to their garbage content: most files are either almost all live data or they are all garbage. The technique consists of two main principles: Chunks are selected based on their Cost-Benefit factor (see below). Records are sorted by age before copying to new chunks. Cost-Benefit Factor The Cost-Benefit factor of a chunk consists of two components multiplied together: The ratio of benefit (amount of garbage that can be collected) to I\/O cost (amount of live data to be written). The age of the data in the chunk, measured as the age of the youngest record it contains. The essence is in the second component: given equal amount of garbage in all chunks, it will make the young ones less attractive to the Collector. Assuming the generational garbage hypothesis, this will allow the young chunks to quickly accumulate more garbage. On the flip side, it will also ensure that even files with little garbage are eventually garbage collected. This removes garbage which would otherwise linger on, thinly spread across many chunk files. Sorting records by age will group young records together in a single chunk and will do the same for older records. Therefore the chunks will either tend to keep their data live for a longer time, or quickly become full of garbage.","tags":"","url":"Storage\/Hot_Restart_Persistence\/Concurrent-Incremental-Generational_GC.html"},{"title":"Performance Considerations","text":"In this section you can find performance test summaries which are results of benchmark tests performed with a single Hazelcast member running on a physical server and on AWS R3.

This is useful when you wish to bring up a new cluster with the same data or parts of the data. The new cluster can then be used to share load with the original cluster, to perform testing, QA or reproduce an issue on production data. Simple file copying of a currently running cluster does not suffice and can produce inconsistent snapshots with problems such as resurrection of deleted values or missing values. Configuring Hot Backup To create snapshots you must first configure the Hot Restart backup directory. You can configure the directory programmatically or declaratively using the following configuration element: backup-dir: This element is included in the hot-restart-persistence and denotes the destination under which backups will be stored. If this element is not defined, hot backup will be disabled. If a directory is defined which does not exist, it will be created on first backup. To avoid clashing data on multiple backups, each backup has a unique sequence ID which determines the name of the directory which will contain all Hot Restart data. This unique directory is created as a subdirectory of the configured backup-dir. The following are examples configurations for Hot backup. Declarative Configuration: An example configuration is shown below. &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;hot-restart-persistence enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; ... &lt;backup-dir&gt;\/mnt\/hot-backup&lt;\/backup-dir&gt; ... &lt;\/hot-restart-persistence&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; Programmatic Configuration: The programmatic equivalent of the above declarative configuration is shown below.

The backup is started transactionally and cluster-wide. This means that either all none of the members will start the same backup. The member which receives the backup request will determine a new backup sequence ID and send that information to all members. If all members respond that no other backup is currently in progress and that no other backup request has already been made, then the coordinating member will command the other members to start the actual backup process. This will create a directory under the configured backup-dir with the name backup-&lt;backupSeq&gt; and start copying the data from the original store. The backup process is initiated nearly instantaneously on all members. Note that since there is no limitation as to when the backup process is initiated, it may be initiated during membership changes, partition table changes or during normal data update. Some of these operations may not be completed fully yet, which means that some members will backup some data while some members will backup a previous version of the same data. This will usually be solved by the anti-entropy mechanism on the new cluster which will reconcile different versions of the same data. Please check the Achieving High Consistency of Backup Data section below for more information. The duration of the backup process and the disk data usage drastically depends on what is supported by the system and the configuration. Please check the Achieving high performance of backup process section below for more information on achieving better resource usage of the backup process. Following is an example of how to trigger the Hot Backup via API: HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService(); service.backup(); You can also define the backup sequence yourself: HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService(); long backupSeq = ... service.backup(backupSeq); Keep in mind that the backup will fail if any member contains a backup directory with the name backup-&lt;backupSeq&gt;, where backupSeq is the given sequence. Achieving High Consistency of Backup Data The backup is initiated nearly simultaneously on all members but you can encounter some inconsistencies in the data. This is because some members might have and some might not have received updated values yet from executed operations, because the system could be undergoing partition and membership changes or because there are some transactions which have not yet been committed. To achieve a high consistency of data on all members, the cluster should be put to PASSIVE state for the duration of the call to the backup method. See the Cluster Member States section on information on how to do this. The cluster does not need to be in PASSIVE state for the entire duration of the backup process, though. Because of the design, only partition metadata is copied synchronously during the invocation of the backup method. Once the backup method has returned all cluster metadata has been copied and the exact partition data which needs to be copied will have been marked. After that, the backup process continues asynchronously and you can return the cluster to the ACTIVE state and resume operations. Achieving High Performance of Backup Process Because of the design of Hot Restart Store, we can use hard links to achieve backups\/snapshots of the store. The hot backup process will use hard links whenever possible because they provide big performance benefits and because the backups share disk usage. The performance benefit comes from the fact that Hot Restart file contents are not being duplicated (thus using disk and IO resources) but rather a new file name is created for the same contents on disk (another pointer to the same inode). Since all backups and stores share the same inode, disk usage drops. The bigger the percentage of stable data in the Hot Restart Store (data not undergoing changes), the more files will each backup share with the operational Hot Restart Store and the less disk space it will be using. For the hot backup to use hard links, you must be running Hazelcast members on JDK 7 or higher and must satisfy all requirements for the Files#createLink method to be supported. The backup process will initially attempt to create a new hard link and if that fails for any reason it will continue by copying the data. Subsequent backups will also attempt to use hard links. Backup Process Progress and Completion Only cluster and distributed object metadata is copied synchronously during the invocation of the backup method. The rest of the Hot Restart Store containing partition data will be copied asynchronously after the method call has ended. You can track the progress by API or view it from the management center. An example of how to track the progress via API is shown below: HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService(); HotRestartStateImpl status = service.getBackupTaskStatus(); ... The returned object contains local member backup status: the backup state (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, FAILURE, SUCCESS) the completed count the total count The completed and total count can provide you a way to track the percentage of the copied data. Currently the count defines the number of copied and total local member Hot Restart Stores (defined by HotRestartPersistenceConfig#setParallelism) but this can change at a later point to provide greater resolution. Besides tracking the Hot Restart status by API, you can view the status in the management center and you can inspect the on-disk files for each member. Each member creates an inprogress file which is created in each of the copied Hot Restart Stores. This means that the backup is currently in progress. As the backup task completes the backup operation, the file will be removed. If an error occurs during the backup task, the inprogress file will be renamed to failure and it will contain a stack trace of the exception. Backup Task Interruption and Cancellation Once the backup method call has returned and asynchronous copying of the partition data has started, the backup task can be interrupted. This is helpful in situations where the backup task has started at an inconvenient time. For instance, the backup task could be automatized and it could be accidentally triggered during high load on the Hazelcast instances, causing the performance of the Hazelcast instances to drop. The backup task mainly uses disk IO, consumes little CPU and it generally does not last for a long time (although you should test it with your environment to determine the exact impact). Nevertheless, you can abort the backup tasks on all members via a cluster-wide interrupt operation. This operation can be triggered programmatically or from the management center. An example of programmatic interruption is shown below: HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService(); service.interruptBackupTask(); ... This method will send an interrupt to all members. The interrupt is ignored if the backup task is currently not in progress so you can safely call this method even though it has previously been called or when some members have already completed their local backup tasks. You can also interrupt the local member backup task as shown below: HotRestartService service = instance.getCluster().getHotRestartService(); service.interruptLocalBackupTask(); ... The backup task will stop as soon as possible and it will not remove the disk contents of the backup directory meaning that you must remove it manually.","tags":"","url":"Storage\/Hot_Restart_Persistence\/Hot_Backup.html"},{"title":"Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache","text":"Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise With Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache, you can reduce the latency of propagation of data from your backend database into your Hazelcast cache to milliseconds. You have the flexibility to run multiple applications off a single database, keeping Hazelcast cache refreshes current while adhering to low latency SLAs. This joint solution with Hazelcast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in-memory data grid uses Striim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Change Data Capture (CDC) to solve the cache consistency problems. When you have an application that needs to retrieve and store information in a database, you can use a Hazelcast in-memory cache for rapid access to data. There may be some other applications that make database updates; in this case, your application may show out-of-date or invalid information. Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache solves this by using streaming CDC to synchronize the cache with the database in real time. This ensures that both the cache and your application always have the most current data. Through CDC, Striim is able to recognize which tables and key values have changed. It immediately captures these changes with their table and key, and, using the Hazelcast Striim writer, pushes those changes into the cache. To learn more, please see the full press release, visit the Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache product page, or download a fully loaded evaluation copy of Striim for Hazelcast Hot Cache.","tags":"","url":"Storage\/Hazelcast_Striim_Hot_Cache.html"},{"title":"Hazelcast Java Client","text":"There are currently three ways to connect to a running Hazelcast cluster natively: Native Java Client Native C++ Client Native .NET Client Please also check the Other Client and Language Implementations. Native Clients enable you to perform almost all Hazelcast operations without being a member of the cluster. It connects to one of the cluster members and delegates all cluster wide operations to it (dummy client), or it connects to all of them and delegates operations smartly (smart client). When the relied cluster member dies, the client will transparently switch to another live member. Hundreds or even thousands of clients can be connected to the cluster. By default, there are core count * 10 threads on the server side that will handle all the requests, e.g., if the server has 4 cores, there will be 40 threads. Imagine a trading application where all the trading data are stored and managed in a Hazelcast cluster with tens of members. Swing\/Web applications at the traders' desktops can use Native Clients to access and modify the data in the Hazelcast cluster. Currently, Hazelcast has Java, C++ and .NET Clients as native clients. This chapter describes the Java Client. IMPORTANT: Starting with the release 3.5, a new Java Native Client Library is introduced in the release package. This library contains clients which use the new Hazelcast Open Binary Client Protocol. For 3.5.x releases: You can use the new client experimentally with the library hazelcast-client-new. This library does not exist for the releases before 3.5. Please do not use this library with the Hazelcast clusters from 3.6.x and higher releases since it is not compatible with those releases. For 3.6.x releases: You can use the new client with the library hazelcast-client. The old client's library is hazelcast-client-legacy, and you can still use it. For 3.7.x and higher releases: There is no more old client for these releases.

Smart mode is the default mode. Dummy Client: For some cases, the clients can be required to connect to a single member instead of to each member in the cluster. Firewalls, security, or some custom networking issues can be the reason for these cases. In dummy client mode, the client will only connect to one of the configured addresses. This single member will behave as a gateway to the other members.

You can configure connectionAttemptLimit for the number of times you want the client to retry connecting. Please see Setting Connection Attempt Limit. The client executes each operation through the already established connection to the cluster. If this connection(s) disconnects or drops, the client will try to reconnect as configured. Handling Retry-able Operation Failure While sending the requests to related members, operations can fail due to various reasons. Read-only operations are retried by default. If you want to enable retry for the other operations, set the redoOperation to true. Please see Enabling Redo Operation. You can set a timeout for retrying the operations sent to a member. This can be provided by using the property hazelcast.client.invocation.timeout.seconds in ClientProperties. The client will retry an operation within this given period, of course, if it is a read-only operation or you enabled the redoOperation as stated in the above paragraph. This timeout value is important when there is a failure resulted by either of the following causes: Member throws an exception. Connection between the client and member is closed.

When you use clients in other languages, you should check for the exceptions. As a general rule, you configure these data structures on the server side and access them through a proxy on the client side. Using Map with Java Client You can use any distributed map object with the client, as shown below. Imap&lt;Integer, String&gt; map = client.getMap(\u00e2\u0080\u009cmyMap\u00e2\u0080\u009d); map.put(1, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAli\u00e2\u0080\u009d); String value= map.get(1); map.remove(1); Locality is ambiguous for the client, so addLocalEntryListener and localKeySet are not supported.

IExecutorService executorService = client.getExecutorService(&quot;default&quot;); After getting an instance of IExecutorService, you can use the instance as the interface with the one provided on the server side. Please see the Distributed Computing chapter for detailed usage. NOTE: This service is only supported by the Java client. Listening to Client Connection If you need to track clients and you want to listen to their connection events, you can use the clientConnected and clientDisconnected methods of the ClientService class.

System property: The client first checks if hazelcast.client.config system property is set to a file path, e.g., -Dhazelcast.client.config=C:\/myhazelcast.xml. Classpath: If config file is not set as a system property, the client checks the classpath for hazelcast-client.xml file. If the client does not find any configuration file, it starts with the default configuration (hazelcast-client-default.xml) located in the hazelcast-client.jar library. Before configuring the client, please try to work with the default configuration to see if it works for you. The default should be just fine for most users. If not, then consider custom configuration for your environment. If you want to specify your own configuration file to create a Config object, the Hazelcast client supports the following. Config cfg = new XmlClientConfigBuilder(xmlFileName).build(); Config cfg = new XmlClientConfigBuilder(inputStream).build(); For programmatic configuration of the Hazelcast Java Client, just instantiate a ClientConfig object and configure the desired aspects.

ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig(); Configuring Address List Address List is the initial list of cluster addresses to which the client will connect. The client uses this list to find an alive member. Although it may be enough to give only one address of a member in the cluster (since all members communicate with each other), it is recommended that you give the addresses for all the members. Declarative: &lt;hazelcast-client&gt; ... &lt;network&gt; &lt;cluster-members&gt; &lt;address&gt;10.1.1.21&lt;\/address&gt; &lt;address&gt;10.1.1.22:5703&lt;\/address&gt; &lt;\/cluster-members&gt; ... &lt;\/network&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast-client&gt; Programmatic: ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig(); networkConfig.addAddress(&quot;10.1.1.21&quot;, &quot;10.1.1.22:5703&quot;); If the port part is omitted, then 5701, 5702, and 5703 will be tried in random order. You can provide multiple addresses with ports provided or not, as seen above. The provided list is shuffled and tried in random order. Default value is localhost. Setting Smart Routing Smart routing defines whether the client mode is smart or dummy. The following are example configurations. Declarative: ... &lt;network&gt; ... &lt;smart-routing&gt;true&lt;\/smart-routing&gt; ... &lt;\/network&gt; ... Programmatic: ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig(); networkConfig().setSmartRouting(true); The default is smart client mode. Enabling Redo Operation It enables\/disables redo-able operations as described in Handling Retry-able Operation Failure. The following are the example configurations. Declarative: ... &lt;network&gt; ... &lt;redo-operation&gt;true&lt;\/redo-operation&gt; ... &lt;\/network&gt; Programmatic: ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); ClientNetworkConfig networkConfig = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig(); networkConfig().setRedoOperation(true); Default is disabled. Setting Connection Timeout Connection timeout is the timeout value in milliseconds for members to accept client connection requests. The following are the example configurations. Declarative: ... &lt;network&gt; ... &lt;connection-timeout&gt;5000&lt;\/connection-timeout&gt; ... &lt;\/network&gt; Programmatic: ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().setConnectionTimeout(5000); The default value is 5000 milliseconds. Setting Connection Attempt Limit While the client is trying to connect initially to one of the members in the ClientNetworkConfig.addressList, all members might be not available. Instead of giving up, throwing an exception and stopping the client, the client will retry as many as ClientNetworkConfig.connectionAttemptLimit times. This is also the case when an existing client-member connection goes down. The following are example configurations. Declarative: ... &lt;network&gt; ... &lt;connection-attempt-limit&gt;5&lt;\/connection-attempt-limit&gt; ... &lt;\/network&gt; Programmatic: ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().setConnectionAttemptLimit(5); Default value is 2. Setting Connection Attempt Period Connection timeout period is the duration in milliseconds between the connection attempts defined by ClientNetworkConfig.connectionAttemptLimit. The following are example configurations. Declarative: ... &lt;network&gt; ... &lt;connection-attempt-period&gt;5000&lt;\/connection-attempt-period&gt; ... &lt;\/network&gt; Programmatic: ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().setConnectionAttemptPeriod(5000); Default value is 3000. Setting a Socket Interceptor Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Following is a client configuration to set a socket intercepter. Any class implementing com.hazelcast.nio.SocketInterceptor is a socket interceptor. public interface SocketInterceptor { void init(Properties properties); void onConnect(Socket connectedSocket) throws IOException; } SocketInterceptor has two steps. First, it will be initialized by the configured properties. Second, it will be informed just after the socket is connected using onConnect. SocketInterceptorConfig socketInterceptorConfig = clientConfig .getNetworkConfig().getSocketInterceptorConfig(); MyClientSocketInterceptor myClientSocketInterceptor = new MyClientSocketInterceptor(); socketInterceptorConfig.setEnabled(true); socketInterceptorConfig.setImplementation(myClientSocketInterceptor); If you want to configure the socket connector with a class name instead of an instance, see the example below. SocketInterceptorConfig socketInterceptorConfig = clientConfig .getNetworkConfig().getSocketInterceptorConfig(); MyClientSocketInterceptor myClientSocketInterceptor = new MyClientSocketInterceptor(); socketInterceptorConfig.setEnabled(true); \/\/These properties are provided to interceptor during init socketInterceptorConfig.setProperty(&quot;kerberos-host&quot;,&quot;kerb-host-name&quot;); socketInterceptorConfig.setProperty(&quot;kerberos-config-file&quot;,&quot;kerb.conf&quot;); socketInterceptorConfig.setClassName(myClientSocketInterceptor); RELATED INFORMATION Please see the Socket Interceptor section for more information. Configuring Network Socket Options You can configure the network socket options using SocketOptions. It has the following methods. socketOptions.setKeepAlive(x): Enables\/disables the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option. The default value is true. socketOptions.setTcpNoDelay(x): Enables\/disables the TCP_NODELAY socket option. The default value is true. socketOptions.setReuseAddress(x): Enables\/disables the SO_REUSEADDR socket option. The default value is true. socketOptions.setLingerSeconds(x): Enables\/disables SO_LINGER with the specified linger time in seconds. The default value is 3. socketOptions.setBufferSize(x): Sets the SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF options to the specified value in KB for this Socket. The default value is 32. SocketOptions socketOptions = clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().getSocketOptions(); socketOptions.setBufferSize(32); socketOptions.setKeepAlive(true); socketOptions.setTcpNoDelay(true); socketOptions.setReuseAddress(true); socketOptions.setLingerSeconds(3); Enabling Client SSL Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise You can use SSL to secure the connection between the client and the members. If you want SSL enabled for the client-cluster connection, you should set SSLConfig. Once set, the connection (socket) is established out of an SSL factory defined either by a factory class name or factory implementation.

The data you need may not be present on the local member, and in that case, Hazelcast retrieves that data from another member. This requires serialization. Hazelcast serializes all your objects into an instance of com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.Data. Data is the binary representation of an object. Serialization is used when: key\/value objects are added to a map, items are put in a queue\/set\/list, a runnable is sent using an executor service, an entry processing is performed within a map, an object is locked, and a message is sent to a topic. Hazelcast optimizes the serialization for the basic types and their array types. You cannot override this behavior.

Custom Serialization (using StreamSerializer and ByteArraySerializer). Global Serializer: Please see the Global Serializer section for details. When Hazelcast serializes an object into Data: (1) It first checks whether the object is null. (2) If the above check fails, then Hazelcast checks if it is an instance of com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.DataSerializable or com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.IdentifiedDataSerializable. (3) If the above check fails, then Hazelcast checks if it is an instance of com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.Portable. (4) If the above check fails, then Hazelcast checks if it is an instance of one of the default types (see the Serialization chapter introduction for default types). (5) If the above check fails, then Hazelcast looks for a user-specified Custom Serializer, i.e. an implementation of ByteArraySerializer or StreamSerializer. Custom serializer is searched using the input Object's Class and its parent class up to Object. If parent class search fails, all interfaces implemented by the class are also checked (excluding java.io.Serializable and java.io.Externalizable). (6) If the above check fails, then Hazelcast checks if it is an instance of java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable and a Global Serializer is not registered with Java Serialization Override feature. (7) If the above check fails, Hazelcast will use the registered Global Serializer if one exists. If all of the above checks fail, then serialization will fail. When a class implements multiple interfaces, the above steps are important to determine the serialization mechanism that Hazelcast will use. When a class definition is required for any of these serializations, you need to have all the classes needed by the application on your classpath because Hazelcast does not download them automatically.","tags":"","url":"Serialization\/Serialization_Interface_Types.html"},{"title":"Comparing Serialization Interfaces","text":"The table below provides a comparison between the interfaces listed in the previous section to help you in deciding which interface to use in your applications.

Let's take a look at the example code below for Java Serializable. public class Employee implements Serializable { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; private String surname; public Employee( String surname ) { this.surname = surname; } } Here, the fields that are non-static and non-transient are automatically serialized. To eliminate class compatibility issues, it is recommended that you add a serialVersionUID, as shown above. Also, when you are using methods that perform byte-content comparisons, such as IMap.replace(), and if byte-content of equal objects is different, you may face unexpected behaviors. For example, if the class relies on a hash map, the replace method may fail. The reason for this is the hash map is a serialized data structure with unreliable byte-content. Implementing Java Externalizable Hazelcast also supports java.io.Externalizable. This interface offers more control on the way fields are serialized or deserialized. Compared to native Java serialization, it also can have a positive effect on performance. With java.io.Externalizable, there is no need to add serialVersionUID. Let's take a look at the example code below. public class Employee implements Externalizable { private String surname; public Employee(String surname) { this.surname = surname; } @Override public void readExternal( ObjectInput in ) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { this.surname = in.readUTF(); } @Override public void writeExternal( ObjectOutput out ) throws IOException { out.writeUTF(surname); } } You explicitly perform writing and reading of fields. Perform reading in the same order as writing.","tags":"","url":"Serialization\/Implementing_Java_Serializable_and_Externalizable.html"},{"title":"Implementing DataSerializable","text":"As mentioned in Implementing Java Serializable &amp; Externalizable, Java serialization is an easy mechanism. However, it does not control how fields are serialized or deserialized. Moreover, Java serialization can lead to excessive CPU loads since it keeps track of objects to handle the cycles and streams class descriptors. These are performance decreasing factors; thus, serialized data may not have an optimal size. The DataSerializable interface of Hazelcast overcomes these issues. Here is an example of a class implementing the com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.DataSerializable interface. public class Address implements DataSerializable { private String street; private int zipCode; private String city; private String state; public Address() {} \/\/getters setters.. public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out ) throws IOException { out.writeUTF(street); out.writeInt(zipCode); out.writeUTF(city); out.writeUTF(state); } public void readData( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException { street = in.readUTF(); zipCode = in.readInt(); city = in.readUTF(); state = in.readUTF(); } } Reading and Writing and DataSerializable Let's take a look at another example which encapsulates a DataSerializable field. Since the address field itself is DataSerializable, it calls address.writeData(out) when writing and address.readData(in) when reading. Also note that you should have writing and reading of the fields occur in the same order. When Hazelcast serializes a DataSerializable, it writes the className first. When Hazelcast deserializes it, className is used to instantiate the object using reflection. public class Employee implements DataSerializable { private String firstName; private String lastName; private int age; private double salary; private Address address; \/\/address itself is DataSerializable public Employee() {} \/\/getters setters.. public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out ) throws IOException { out.writeUTF(firstName); out.writeUTF(lastName); out.writeInt(age); out.writeDouble (salary); address.writeData (out); } public void readData( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException { firstName = in.readUTF(); lastName = in.readUTF(); age = in.readInt(); salary = in.readDouble(); address = new Address(); \/\/ since Address is DataSerializable let it read its own internal state address.readData(in); } } As you can see, since the address field itself is DataSerializable, it calls address.writeData(out) when writing and address.readData(in) when reading. Also note that you should have writing and reading of the fields occur in the same order. While Hazelcast serializes a DataSerializable, it writes the className first. When Hazelcast deserializes it, className is used to instantiate the object using reflection. NOTE: Since Hazelcast needs to create an instance during deserialization,DataSerializable class has a no-arg constructor. NOTE: DataSerializable is a good option if serialization is only needed for in-cluster communication. NOTE: DataSerializable is not supported by non-Java clients as it uses Java reflection. If you need non-Java clients, please use IdentifiedDataSerializable or Portable. IdentifiedDataSerializable For a faster serialization of objects, avoiding reflection and long class names, Hazelcast recommends you implement com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.IdentifiedDataSerializable which is a slightly better version of DataSerializable. DataSerializable uses reflection to create a class instance, as mentioned in Implementing DataSerializable. But IdentifiedDataSerializable uses a factory for this purpose and it is faster during deserialization, which requires new instance creations. getID and getFactoryId Methods IdentifiedDataSerializable extends DataSerializable and introduces two new methods. int getId(); int getFactoryId(); IdentifiedDataSerializable uses getId() instead of class name, and it uses getFactoryId() to load the class when given the Id. To complete the implementation, you should also implement com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.DataSerializableFactory and register it into SerializationConfig, which can be accessed from Config.getSerializationConfig(). Factory's responsibility is to return an instance of the right IdentifiedDataSerializable object, given the Id. This is currently the most efficient way of Serialization that Hazelcast supports off the shelf. Implementing IdentifiedDataSerializable Let's take a look at the following example code and configuration to see IdentifiedDataSerializable in action. public class Employee implements IdentifiedDataSerializable { private String surname; public Employee() {} public Employee( String surname ) { this.surname = surname; } @Override public void readData( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException { this.surname = in.readUTF(); } @Override public void writeData( ObjectDataOutput out ) throws IOException { out.writeUTF( surname ); } @Override public int getFactoryId() { return EmployeeDataSerializableFactory.FACTORY_ID; } @Override public int getId() { return EmployeeDataSerializableFactory.EMPLOYEE_TYPE; } @Override public String toString() { return String.format( &quot;Employee(surname=%s)&quot;, surname ); } } The methods getId and getFactoryId return a unique positive number within the EmployeeDataSerializableFactory. Now, let's create an instance of this EmployeeDataSerializableFactory. public class EmployeeDataSerializableFactory implements DataSerializableFactory{ public static final int FACTORY_ID = 1; public static final int EMPLOYEE_TYPE = 1; @Override public IdentifiedDataSerializable create(int typeId) { if ( typeId == EMPLOYEE_TYPE ) { return new Employee(); } else { return null; } } } The only method you should implement is create, as seen in the above example. It is recommended that you use a switch-case statement instead of multiple if-else blocks if you have a lot of subclasses. Hazelcast throws an exception if null is returned for typeId. Registering EmployeeDataSerializableFactory As the last step, you need to register EmployeeDataSerializableFactory declaratively (declare in the configuration file hazelcast.xml) as shown below. Note that factory-id has the same value of FACTORY_ID in the above code. This is crucial to enable Hazelcast to find the correct factory. &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;serialization&gt; &lt;data-serializable-factories&gt; &lt;data-serializable-factory factory-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt; EmployeeDataSerializableFactory &lt;\/data-serializable-factory&gt; &lt;\/data-serializable-factories&gt; &lt;\/serialization&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; RELATED INFORMATION Please refer to the Serialization Configuration Wrap-Up section for a full description of Hazelcast Serialization configuration.","tags":"","url":"Serialization\/Implementing_DataSerializable.html"},{"title":"Implementing Portable Serialization","text":"As an alternative to the existing serialization methods, Hazelcast offers a language\/platform independent Portable serialization that has the following advantages: Supports multi-version of the same object type. Fetches individual fields without having to rely on reflection. Queries and indexing support without deserialization and\/or reflection. In order to support these features, a serialized Portable object contains meta information like the version and the concrete location of the each field in the binary data. This way, Hazelcast navigates in the byte[] and deserializes only the required field without actually deserializing the whole object. This improves the Query performance. With multi-version support, you can have two cluster members where each has different versions of the same object. Hazelcast will store both meta information and use the correct one to serialize and deserialize Portable objects depending on the member. This is very helpful when you are doing a rolling upgrade without shutting down the cluster. Portable serialization is totally language independent and is used as the binary protocol between Hazelcast server and clients.","tags":"","url":"Serialization\/Implementing_Portable_Serialization\/index.html"},{"title":"Example Code","text":"Here is example code for Portable implementation of a Foo class. public class Foo implements Portable{ final static int ID = 5; private String foo; public String getFoo() { return foo; } public void setFoo( String foo ) { this.foo = foo; } @Override public int getFactoryId() { return 1; } @Override public int getClassId() { return ID; } @Override public void writePortable( PortableWriter writer ) throws IOException { writer.writeUTF( &quot;foo&quot;, foo ); } @Override public void readPortable( PortableReader reader ) throws IOException { foo = reader.readUTF( &quot;foo&quot; ); } } Similar to IdentifiedDataSerializable, a Portable Class must provide classId and factoryId.

For example, a client may have an older version of a class, and the member to which it is connected may have a newer version of the same class. Portable serialization supports versioning. It is a global versioning, meaning that all portable classes that are serialized through a member get the globally configured portable version. You can declare Version in the configuration file hazelcast.xml using the portable-version element, as shown below. &lt;serialization&gt; &lt;portable-version&gt;1&lt;\/portable-version&gt; &lt;portable-factories&gt; &lt;portable-factory factory-id=&quot;1&quot;&gt; PortableFactoryImpl &lt;\/portable-factory&gt; &lt;\/portable-factories&gt; &lt;\/serialization&gt; You can also use the interface VersionedPortable which enables to upgrade the version per class, instead of global versioning. If you need to update only one class, you can use this interface. In this case, your class should implement VersionedPortable instead of Portable, and you can give the desired version using the method VersionedPortable.getClassVersion(). You should consider the following when you perform versioning. It is important to change the version whenever an update is performed in the serialized fields of a class, for example by incrementing the version. If a client performs a Portable deserialization on a field, and then that Portable is updated by removing that field on the cluster side, this may lead to a problem. Portable serialization does not use reflection and hence, fields in the class and in the serialized content are not automatically mapped. Field renaming is a simpler process. Also, since the class ID is stored, renaming the Portable does not lead to problems. Types of fields need to be updated carefully. Hazelcast performs basic type upgradings, such as int to float. Example Portable Versioning Scenarios Assume that a new member joins to the cluster with a class that has been modified and class' version has been upgraded due to this modification. If you modified the class by adding a new field, the new member's put operations will include that new field. If this new member tries to get an object that was put from the older members, it will get null for the newly added field. If you modified the class by removing a field, the old members get null for the objects that are put by the new member. If you modified the class by changing the type of a field, the error IncompatibleClassChangeError is generated unless the change was made on a built-in type or the byte size of the new type is less than or equal to the old one. The following are example allowed type conversions: long -&gt; int, byte, char, short int-&gt; byte, char, short If you have not modify a class at all, it will work as usual.","tags":"","url":"Serialization\/Implementing_Portable_Serialization\/Versioning_for_Portable_Serialization.html"},{"title":"Ordering Consistency for writePortable","text":"Independent of the member-member or member-client communications, the method writePortable() of the classes that implement Portable should be consistent.

This is a good option for your own implementations. It can also be adapted to external serialization libraries like Kryo, JSON, and protocol buffers. StreamSerializer Example Code 1 First, let's create a simple object. public class Employee { private String surname; public Employee( String surname ) { this.surname = surname; } } Now, let's implement StreamSerializer for Employee class. public class EmployeeStreamSerializer implements StreamSerializer&lt;Employee&gt; { @Override public int getTypeId () { return 1; } @Override public void write( ObjectDataOutput out, Employee employee ) throws IOException { out.writeUTF(employee.getSurname()); } @Override public Employee read( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException { String surname = in.readUTF(); return new Employee(surname); } @Override public void destroy () { } } In practice, classes may have many fields. Just make sure the fields are read in the same order as they are written. The type ID must be unique and greater than or equal to 1. Uniqueness of the type ID enables Hazelcast to determine which serializer will be used during deserialization. As the last step, let's register the EmployeeStreamSerializer in the configuration file hazelcast.xml, as shown below. &lt;serialization&gt; &lt;serializers&gt; &lt;serializer type-class=&quot;Employee&quot; class-name=&quot;EmployeeStreamSerializer&quot; \/&gt; &lt;\/serializers&gt; &lt;\/serialization&gt; NOTE: StreamSerializer cannot be created for well-known types, such as Long and String, and primitive arrays.

First you need to implement a com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.StreamSerializer. A very simple one that uses XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder could look like the following: public static class FooXmlSerializer implements StreamSerializer&lt;Foo&gt; { @Override public int getTypeId() { return 10; } @Override public void write( ObjectDataOutput out, Foo object ) throws IOException { ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); XMLEncoder encoder = new XMLEncoder( bos ); encoder.writeObject( object ); encoder.close(); out.write( bos.toByteArray() ); } @Override public Foo read( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException { InputStream inputStream = (InputStream) in; XMLDecoder decoder = new XMLDecoder( inputStream ); return (Foo) decoder.readObject(); } @Override public void destroy() { } } Configuring StreamSerializer Note that typeId must be unique because Hazelcast will use it to look up the StreamSerializer while it deserializes the object. The last required step is to register the StreamSerializer in your Hazelcast configuration. Below are the programmatic and declarative configurations for this step. SerializerConfig sc = new SerializerConfig() .setImplementation(new FooXmlSerializer()) .setTypeClass(Foo.class); Config config = new Config(); config.getSerializationConfig().addSerializerConfig(sc); &lt;hazelcast&gt; &lt;serialization&gt; &lt;serializers&gt; &lt;serializer type-class=&quot;com.www.Foo&quot; class-name=&quot;com.www.FooXmlSerializer&quot; \/&gt; &lt;\/serializers&gt; &lt;\/serialization&gt; &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; From now on, this Hazelcast example will use FooXmlSerializer to serialize Foo objects.

The global serializer is registered as a fallback serializer to handle all other objects if a serializer cannot be located for them. By default, the global serializer does not handle java.io.Serializable and java.io.Externalizable instances. However, you can configure it to be responsible for those instances. A custom serializer should be registered for a specific class type. The global serializer will handle all class types if all the steps in searching for a serializer fail as described in Serialization Interface Types. Use cases Third party serialization frameworks can be integrated using the global serializer. For your custom objects, you can implement a single serializer to handle all of them. You can replace the internal Java serialization by enabling the overrideJavaSerialization option of the global serializer configuration. Any custom serializer can be used as the global serializer. Please refer to the Custom Serialization section for implementation details. NOTE: To function properly, Hazelcast needs the Java serializable objects to be handled correctly. If the global serializer is configured to handle the Java serialization, the global serializer must properly serialize\/deserialize the java.io.Serializable instances. Otherwise, it causes Hazelcast to malfunction. Sample Global Serializer A sample global serializer that integrates with a third party serializer is shown below. public class GlobalStreamSerializer implements StreamSerializer&lt;Object&gt; { private SomeThirdPartySerializer someThirdPartySerializer; private init() { \/\/someThirdPartySerializer = ... } @Override public int getTypeId () { return 123; } @Override public void write( ObjectDataOutput out, Object object ) throws IOException { byte[] bytes = someThirdPartySerializer.encode(object); out.writeByteArray(bytes); } @Override public Object read( ObjectDataInput in ) throws IOException { byte[] bytes = in.readByteArray(); return someThirdPartySerializer.decode(bytes); } @Override public void destroy () { someThirdPartySerializer.destroy(); } } Now, we can register the global serializer in the configuration file hazelcast.xml, as shown below. &lt;serialization&gt; &lt;serializers&gt; &lt;global-serializer override-java-serialization=&quot;true&quot;&gt;GlobalStreamSerializer&lt;\/global-serializer&gt; &lt;\/serializers&gt; &lt;\/serialization&gt;","tags":"","url":"Serialization\/Global_Serializer.html"},{"title":"Implementing HazelcastInstanceAware","text":"You can implement the HazelcastInstanceAware interface to access distributed objects for cases where an object is deserialized and needs access to HazelcastInstance.

Notice the hazelcastInstance is transient. This is because this field should not be serialized. It may be a good practice to inject a HazelcastInstance into a domain object, e.g., Employee in the above sample, when used together with Runnable\/Callable implementations. These runnables\/callables are executed by IExecutorService which sends them to another machine. And after a task is deserialized, run\/call method implementations need to access HazelcastInstance.

In the above sample, _hzInstance_1_dev is the instance name, we connect to an IMap with the name trial. Connecting to JMX Agent One of the ways you can connect to JMX agent is using jconsole, jvisualvm (with MBean plugin) or another JMX compliant monitoring tool. The other way to connect is to use a custom JMX client. First, you need to specify the URL where the Hazelcast JMX service is running. Please see the following sample code snippet. The port in this sample should be the one that you define while setting the JMX remote port number (if different than the default port 1099). \/\/ Parameters for connecting to the JMX Service int port = 1099; String hostname = InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName(); JMXServiceURL url = new JMXServiceURL(&quot;service:jmx:rmi:\/\/&quot; + hostname + &quot;:&quot; + port + &quot;\/jndi\/rmi:\/\/&quot; + hostname + &quot;:&quot; + port + &quot;\/jmxrmi&quot;); Then use the URL you acquired to connect to the JMX service and get the JMXConnector object.

This section explains these states of Hazelcast clusters and members which you can use to allow or restrict the designated cluster\/member operations. Cluster States By changing the state of your cluster, you can allow\/restrict several cluster operations or change the behavior of those operations. You can use the methods changeClusterState() and shutdown() which are in the Cluster interface to change your cluster's state. Hazelcast clusters have the following states: ACTIVE: This is the default cluster state. Cluster continues to operate without restrictions. FROZEN: In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed. Your cluster does not accept new members. If a member leaves, it can join back. Its partition assignments (both primary and replica) remain the same until either it joins back or the cluster state is changed to ACTIVE. When it joins back to the cluster, it will own all previous partition assignments as it was. On the other hand, when the cluster state changes to ACTIVE, re-partitioning starts and unassigned partitions are assigned to the active members. All other operations in the cluster, except migration, continue without restrictions. You cannot change the state of a cluster to FROZEN when migration\/replication tasks are being performed. PASSIVE: In this state, the partition table is frozen and partition assignments are not performed. Your cluster does not accept new members. If a member leaves while the cluster is in this state, the member will be removed from the partition table if cluster state moves back to ACTIVE. This state rejects ALL operations immediately EXCEPT the read-only operations like map.get() and cache.get(), replication and cluster heartbeat tasks. You cannot change the state of a cluster to PASSIVE when migration\/replication tasks are being performed. IN_TRANSITION: This state shows that the state of the cluster is in transition. You cannot set your cluster's state as IN_TRANSITION explicitly. It is a temporary and intermediate state. During this state, your cluster does not accept new members and migration\/replication tasks are paused. NOTE: All in-cluster methods are fail-fast, i.e. when a method fails in the cluster, it throws an exception immediately (it will not be retried). The following snippet is from the Cluster interface showing the new methods used to manage your cluster's states. public interface Cluster { ... ... ClusterState getClusterState(); void changeClusterState(ClusterState newState); void changeClusterState(ClusterState newState, TransactionOptions transactionOptions); void shutdown(); void shutdown(TransactionOptions transactionOptions); Please refer to the Cluster interface for information on these methods. Cluster Member States Hazelcast cluster members have the following states: ACTIVE: This is the initial member state. The member can execute and process all operations. When the state of the cluster is ACTIVE or FROZEN, the members are in the ACTIVE state. PASSIVE: In this state, member rejects all operations EXCEPT the read-only ones, replication and migration operations, heartbeat operations, and the join operations as explained in the Cluster States section above. A member can go into this state when either of the following happens: Until the member's shutdown process is completed after the method Node.shutdown(boolean) is called. Note that, when the shutdown process is completed, member's state changes to SHUT_DOWN. Cluster's state is changed to PASSIVE using the method changeClusterState(). SHUT_DOWN: A member goes into this state when the member's shutdown process is completed. The member in this state rejects all operations and invocations. A member in this state cannot be restarted.","tags":"","url":"Management\/Cluster_Utilities\/Managing_Cluster_and_Member_States.html"},{"title":"Using the Script cluster.sh","text":"You can use the script cluster.sh, which comes with the Hazelcast package, to get\/change the state of your cluster, to shutdown your cluster and to force your cluster to clean its persisted data and make a fresh start.

NOTE: The script cluster.sh uses curl command and curl must be installed to be able to use the script. The script cluster.sh needs the following parameters to operate according to your needs. If these parameters are not provided, the default values are used. Parameter Default Value Description -o or --operation get-state Executes a cluster-wide operation. Operation can be get-state, change-state, shutdown, force-start, get-cluster-version and change-cluster-version. -s or --state None Updates the state of the cluster to a new state. New state can be active, frozen, passive. This is used with the operation change-state. This parameter has no default value; when you use this, you should provide a valid state. -a or --address 127.0.0.1 Defines the IP address of a cluster member. If you want to manage your cluster remotely, you should use this parameter to provide the IP address of a member to this script. -p or --port 5701 Defines on which port Hazelcast is running on the local or remote machine. The default value is 5701. -g or --groupname dev Defines the name of a cluster group which is used for a simple authentication. Please see the Creating Cluster Groups section. -P or --password dev-pass Defines the password of a cluster group. Please see the Creating Cluster Groups section. -v or --version None Defines the cluster version to change to. To be used in conjunction with change-cluster-version operation. The script cluster.sh is self-documented; you can see the parameter descriptions using the command sh cluster.sh -h or sh cluster.sh --help. NOTE: You can perform the above operations using the Hot Restart tab of Hazelcast Management Center or using the REST API.

You perform this shutdown by calling the method HazelcastInstance.shutdown(). Starting with Hazelcast 3.7, the master member migrates all of the replicas owned by the shutdown-requesting member to the other running (not initiated shutdown) cluster members. After these migrations are completed, the shutting down member will not be the owner or a backup of any partition anymore. It means that you can shutdown any number of Hazelcast members in a cluster concurrently with no data loss. Please note that the process of shutting down members waits for a predefined amount of time for the master to migrate their partition replicas. You can specify this graceful shutdown timeout duration using the property hazelcast.graceful.shutdown.max.wait. Its default value is 10 minutes. If migrations are not completed within this duration, shutdown may continue non-gracefully and lead to data loss. Therefore, you should choose your own timeout duration considering the size of data in your cluster. Ensuring Safe State with PartitionService With the improvements in graceful shutdown procedure in Hazelcast 3.7, the following methods are not needed to perform graceful shutdown. Nevertheless, you can use them to check the current safety status of the partitions in your cluster. public interface PartitionService { ... ... boolean isClusterSafe(); boolean isMemberSafe(Member member); boolean isLocalMemberSafe(); boolean forceLocalMemberToBeSafe(long timeout, TimeUnit unit); } The method isClusterSafe checks whether the cluster is in a safe state. It returns true if there are no active partition migrations and all backups are in sync for each partition. The method isMemberSafe checks whether a specific member is in a safe state. It checks if all backups of partitions of the given member are in sync with the primary ones. Once it returns true, the given member is safe and it can be shut down without data loss. Similarly, the method isLocalMemberSafe does the same check for the local member. The method forceLocalMemberToBeSafe forces the owned and backup partitions to be synchronized, making the local member safe. NOTE: If you want to use the above methods, please note that they are available starting with Hazelcast 3.3.

SystemProperties It shows all the properties and their values in your system used by and configured for your Hazelcast installation. These are the properties starting with java (excluding java.awt), hazelcast, sun and os. It also includes the arguments that are used to startup the JVM. ConfigProperties It shows the Hazelcast properties and their values explicitly set by you either on the command line (with -D) or by using declarative\/programmatic configuration. Metrics It shows a comprehensive log of what is happening in your Hazelcast system. You can configure the level of detail and frequency of dumping information to the log file using the following properties: hazelcast.diagnostics.metrics.period.seconds: Set a value in seconds. Its default is 60. hazelcast.diagnostics.metrics.level: Set a level. It can be Mandatory, Info and Debug. Its default is Mandatory. SlowOperations It shows the slow operations and invocations, Please refer to SlowOperationDetector for more information. Invocations It shows all kinds of statistics about current and past invocations including current pending invocations, history of invocations and slow history, i.e. all samples where the invocation took more than the defined threshold. Slow history does not only include the invocations where the operations took a lot of time, but it also includes any other invocations that have been obstructed. Using the following properties, you can configure the frequency of scanning all pending invocations and the threshold that makes an invocation to be considered as slow: hazelcast.diagnostics.invocation.sample.period.seconds: Set a value in seconds. Its default is 60. hazelcast.diagnostics.invocation.slow.threshold.seconds: Set a value in seconds. Its default is 5. HazelcastInstance It shows the basic state of your Hazelcast cluster including the count and addresses of current members and the address of master member. It is useful to get a fast impression of the cluster without needing to analyze a lot of data. You can configure the frequency at which the cluster information is dumped to the log file using the following property: hazelcast.diagnostics.memberinfo.period.second: Set a value in seconds. Its default is 60. SystemLog It shows the activities in your cluster including when a connection\/member is added or removed, and if there is a change in the lifecycle of the cluster.

CPU Utilization This part of the page provides load and utilization information for the CPUs for each cluster member, as shown below. The first column lists the members with their IPs and ports. The next columns list the system load averages on each member for the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. These average values are calculated as the sum of the count of runnable entities running on and queued to the available CPUs averaged over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes. This calculation is operating system specific, typically a damped time-dependent average. If system load average is not available, these columns show negative values. The last column (Chart) graphically shows the recent load on the CPUs. When you move the mouse cursor on a chart, you can see the CPU load at the time where the cursor is placed. Charts under this column shows the CPU loads approximately for the last 2 minutes. If recent CPU load is not available, you will see a negative value. Memory Utilization This part of the page provides information related to memory usages for each member, as shown below. The first column lists the members with their IPs and ports. The next columns show the used and free memories out of the total memory reserved for Hazelcast usage, in real-time. The Max column lists the maximum memory capacity of each member and the Percent column lists the percentage value of used memory out of the maximum memory. The last column (Chart) shows the memory usage of members graphically. When you move the mouse cursor on a desired graph, you can see the memory usage at the time where the cursor is placed. Graphs under this column shows the memory usages approximately for the last 2 minutes. Memory Distribution This part of the page graphically provides the cluster wise breakdown of memory, as shown below. The blue area is the memory used by maps. The dark yellow area is the memory used by both non-Hazelcast entities and all Hazelcast entities except the map (i.e. the memory used by all entities subtracted by the memory used by map). The green area is the free memory out of the whole cluster`s memory capacity. In the above example, you can see 0.32% of the total memory is used by Hazelcast maps (it can be seen by placing the mouse cursor on it), 58.75% is used by non-Hazelcast entities and 40.85% of the total memory is free. Map Memory Distribution This part is the breakdown of the blue area shown in the Memory Distribution graph explained above.

Once you select a member from the menu, a new tab for monitoring that member opens on the right, as shown below. The CPU Utilization chart shows the percentage of CPU usage on the selected member. The Memory Utilization chart shows the memory usage on the selected member with three different metrics (maximum, used and total memory). You can open both of these charts as separate windows using the button placed at top right of each chart; this gives you a clearer view of the chart. The window titled Partitions shows which partitions are assigned to the selected member. Runtime is a dynamically updated window tab showing the processor number, the start and up times, and the maximum, total and free memory sizes of the selected member. These values are collected from the default MXBeans provided by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Descriptions from the Javadocs and some explanations are below: Number of Processors: Number of processors available to the member (JVM). Start Time: Start time of the member (JVM) in milliseconds. Up Time: Uptime of the member (JVM) in milliseconds Maximum Memory: Maximum amount of memory that the member (JVM) will attempt to use. Free Memory: Amount of free memory in the member (JVM). Used Heap Memory: Amount of used memory in bytes. Max Heap Memory: Maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management. Used Non-Heap Memory: Amount of used memory in bytes. Max Non-Heap Memory: Maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management. Total Loaded Classes: Total number of classes that have been loaded since the member (JVM) has started execution. Current Loaded Classes: Number of classes that are currently loaded in the member (JVM). Total Unloaded Classes: Total number of classes unloaded since the member (JVM) has started execution. Total Thread Count: Total number of threads created and also started since the member (JVM) started. Active Thread Count: Current number of live threads including both daemon and non-daemon threads. Peak Thread Count: Peak live thread count since the member (JVM) started or peak was reset. Daemon Thread Count: Current number of live daemon threads. OS: Free Physical Memory: Amount of free physical memory in bytes. OS: Committed Virtual Memory: Amount of virtual memory that is guaranteed to be available to the running process in bytes. OS: Total Physical Memory: Total amount of physical memory in bytes. OS: Free Swap Space: Amount of free swap space in bytes. Swap space is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. OS: Total Swap Space: Total amount of swap space in bytes. OS: Maximum File Descriptor Count: Maximum number of file descriptors. File descriptor is an integer number that uniquely represents an opened file in the operating system. OS: Open File Descriptor Count: Number of open file descriptors. OS: Process CPU Time: CPU time used by the process on which the member (JVM) is running in nanoseconds. OS: Process CPU Load: Recent CPU usage for the member (JVM) process. This is a double with a value from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 means that none of the CPUs were running threads from the member (JVM) process during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running threads from the member (JVM) 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. Threads from the member (JVM) include the application threads as well as the member (JVM) internal threads. OS: System Load Average: System load average for the last minute. The system load average is the average over a period of time of this sum: (the number of runnable entities queued to the available processors) + (the number of runnable entities running on the available processors). The way in which the load average is calculated is operating system specific but it is typically a damped time-dependent average. OS: System CPU Load: Recent CPU usage for the whole system. This is a double with a value from 0.0 to 1.0. A value of 0.0 means that all CPUs were idle during the recent period of time observed, while a value of 1.0 means that all CPUs were actively running 100% of the time during the recent period being observed. NOTE: These descriptions may vary according to the JVM version or vendor. Next to the Runtime tab, the Properties tab shows the system properties.

You can also use the salting process by giving a salt and password which are then concatenated and processed with MD5, and the resulting output is stored with the salt.

Moreover, when you enable encryption on your Hazelcast cluster, the clients will not work, i.e., they will not be able to connect to the cluster. RELATED INFORMATION Please see the SSL section.","tags":"","url":"Security\/Encryption.html"},{"title":"SSL","text":"Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise NOTE: You cannot use SSL when Hazelcast Encryption is enabled. One of the offers of Hazelcast is the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol which you can use to establish an encrypted communication across your cluster. Note that, if you are developing applications using Java 8, you will be using its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security). SSL for Hazelcast Members Hazelcast allows you to encrypt socket level communication between Hazelcast members and between Hazelcast clients and members, for end to end encryption. To use it, you need to implement com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.SSLContextFactory and configure the SSL section in the network configuration. The following is the implementation code snippet: public class MySSLContextFactory implements SSLContextFactory { public void init( Properties properties ) throws Exception { } public SSLContext getSSLContext() { ... SSLContext sslCtx = SSLContext.getInstance( protocol ); return sslCtx; } } The following is the base declarative configuration for the implemented SSLContextFactory: &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;network&gt; ... &lt;ssl enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;factory-class-name&gt; com.hazelcast.examples.MySSLContextFactory &lt;\/factory-class-name&gt; &lt;properties&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;bar&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;\/properties&gt; &lt;\/ssl&gt; &lt;\/network&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; Hazelcast provides a default SSLContextFactory, com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.BasicSSLContextFactory, which uses the configured keystore to initialize SSLContext; see the following example configuration for SSL. &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;network&gt; ... &lt;ssl enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;factory-class-name&gt; com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.BasicSSLContextFactory &lt;\/factory-class-name&gt; &lt;properties&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;keyStore&quot;&gt;keyStore&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;keyStorePassword&quot;&gt;keyStorePassword&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;trustStore&quot;&gt;trustStore&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;trustStorePassword&quot;&gt;trustStorePassword&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;keyManagerAlgorithm&quot;&gt;SunX509&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;trustManagerAlgorithm&quot;&gt;SunX509&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;protocol&quot;&gt;TLS&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;\/properties&gt; &lt;\/ssl&gt; &lt;\/network&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; You can set all the above properties using the javax.net.ssl prefix, e.g., javax.net.ssl.keyStore and javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword. Here are the descriptions for the properties: keystore: Path of your keystore file. Note that your keystore's type must be JKS. keyStorePassword: Password to access the key from your keystore file. truststore: Path of your truststore file. The file truststore is a keystore file that contains a collection of certificates trusted by your application. Its type should be JKS. trustStorePassword: Password to unlock the truststore file. keyManagerAlgorithm: Name of the algorithm based on which the authentication keys are provided. trustManagerAlgorithm: Name of the algorithm based on which the trust managers are provided. protocol: Name of the algorithm which is used in your SSL. Its default value is TLS. Available values are: SSL SSLv2 SSLv3 TLS TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 All of the above algorithms support Java 6 and higher versions, except the TLSv1.2 supports Java 7 and higher versions. For the protocol property, we recommend you to provide SSL or TLS with its version information, e.g., TLSv1.2. Note that if you write only SSL or TLS your application will choose the SSL or TLS version according to your Java version. SSL for Hazelcast Clients Hazelcast Java and .NET clients also have SSL support. Following is a programmatic configuration for Java client: System.setProperty(&quot;javax.net.ssl.keyStore&quot;, new File(&quot;hazelcast.ks&quot;).getAbsolutePath()); System.setProperty(&quot;javax.net.ssl.trustStore&quot;, new File(&quot;hazelcast.ts&quot;).getAbsolutePath()); System.setProperty(&quot;javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword&quot;, &quot;password&quot;); ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig(); clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().addAddress(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;); SSL Performance Improvements for Java SSL can have a significant impact on performance. There are a few ways to increase the performance. The first thing that can be done is making sure that AES intrensics are used. Modern CPUs (2010 or newer Westmere) have hardware support for AES encryption\/decryption and if a Java 8 or newer JVM is used, the JIT will automatically make use of these AES instructions. They can also be explicitly enabled using -XX:+UseAES -XX:+UseAESIntrinsics, or disabled using -XX:-UseAES -XX:-UseAESIntrinsics. A lot of encryption algorithms make use of padding because they encrypt\/decrypt in fixed sized blocks. If not enough data is available for a block, the algorithm relies on random number generation to pad. Under Linux, the JVM automatically makes use of \/dev\/random for the generation of random numbers. \/dev\/random relies on entropy to be able to generate random numbers. However if this entropy is insufficient to keep up with the rate requiring random numbers, it can slow down the encryption\/decryption since \/dev\/random will block; it could block for minutes waiting for sufficient entropy . This can be fixed by adding the following system property -Djava.security.egd=file:\/dev\/.\/urandom. For a more permanent solution, modify &lt;JAVA_HOME&gt;\/jre\/lib\/security\/java.security file, look for the securerandom.source=\/dev\/urandom and change it to securerandom.source=file:\/dev\/.\/urandom. Switching to \/dev\/urandom could be controversial because the \/dev\/urandom will not block if there is a shortage of entropy and the returned random values could theoretically be vulnerable to a cryptographic attack. If this is a concern in your application, use \/dev\/random instead. Another way to increase performance for the Java smart client is to make use of Hazelcast 3.8. In Hazelcast 3.8, the Java smart client automatically makes use of extra I\/O threads for encryption\/decryption and this have a significant impact on the performance. This can be changed using the hazelcast.client.io.input.thread.count and hazelcast.client.io.input.thread.count client system properties. By default it is 1 input thread and 1 output thread. If SSL is enabled, it will default to 3 input threads and 3 output threads. Having more client I\/O threads than members in the cluster will not lead to an increased performance. So with a 2-member cluster, 2 in and 2 out threads will give the best performance.","tags":"","url":"Security\/SSL.html"},{"title":"Credentials","text":"Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise One of the key elements in Hazelcast security is the Credentials object, which carries all credentials of an endpoint (member or client). Credentials is an interface which extends Serializable. You can either implement the three methods in the Credentials interface, or you can extend the AbstractCredentials class, which is an abstract implementation of Credentials. Hazelcast calls the Credentials.setEndpoint() method when an authentication request arrives at the member before authentication takes place. package com.hazelcast.security; public interface Credentials extends Serializable { String getEndpoint(); void setEndpoint( String endpoint ) ; String getPrincipal() ; } Here is an example of extending the AbstractCredentials class. package com.hazelcast.security; ... public abstract class AbstractCredentials implements Credentials, DataSerializable { private transient String endpoint; private String principal; ... } UsernamePasswordCredentials, a custom implementation of Credentials, is in the Hazelcast com.hazelcast.security package.

Credentials is used by LoginModule s during the authentication process. User supplied attributes from LoginModules are accessed by CallbackHandler s. To access the Credentials object, Hazelcast uses its own specialized CallbackHandler. During initialization of LoginModules, Hazelcast passes this special CallbackHandler into the LoginModule.initialize() method. Your implementation of LoginModule should create an instance of com.hazelcast.security.CredentialsCallback and call the handle(Callback[] callbacks) method of CallbackHandler during the login process. CredentialsCallback.getCredentials() returns the supplied Credentials object. public class CustomLoginModule implements LoginModule { CallbackHandler callbackHandler; Subject subject; Credentials credentials; public void initialize( Subject subject, CallbackHandler callbackHandler, Map&lt;String, ?&gt; sharedState, Map&lt;String, ?&gt; options ) { this.subject = subject; this.callbackHandler = callbackHandler; } public final boolean login() throws LoginException { CredentialsCallback callback = new CredentialsCallback(); try { callbackHandler.handle( new Callback[] { callback } ); credentials = callback.getCredentials(); } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new LoginException( e.getMessage() ); } ... } ... } To use the default Hazelcast permission policy, you must create an instance of com.hazelcast.security.ClusterPrincipal that holds the Credentials object, and you must add it to Subject.principals onLoginModule.commit() as shown below. public class MyCustomLoginModule implements LoginModule { ... public boolean commit() throws LoginException { ...

For example, you may wish to have your clients send an identification token in the Credentials object. This token can then be sent to your back-end security system via the LoginModule that runs on the cluster side. Additionally, the same system may authenticate the user and also then return the roles that are attributed to the user. These roles can then be used for data structure authorization.

If related data is on the same member, operations can be executed without the cost of extra network calls and extra wire data. This feature is provided by using the same partition keys for related data. Co-location of related data and computation Hazelcast has a standard way of finding out which member owns\/manages each key object. The following operations will be routed to the same member, since all of them are operating based on the same key &quot;key1&quot;. HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map mapA = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;mapA&quot; ); Map mapB = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;mapB&quot; ); Map mapC = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;mapC&quot; ); \/\/ since map names are different, operation will be manipulating \/\/ different entries, but the operation will take place on the \/\/ same member since the keys (&quot;key1&quot;) are the same mapA.put( &quot;key1&quot;, value ); mapB.get( &quot;key1&quot; ); mapC.remove( &quot;key1&quot; ); \/\/ lock operation will still execute on the same member \/\/ of the cluster since the key (&quot;key1&quot;) is same hazelcastInstance.getLock( &quot;key1&quot; ).lock(); \/\/ distributed execution will execute the 'runnable' on the \/\/ same member since &quot;key1&quot; is passed as the key. hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService().executeOnKeyOwner( runnable, &quot;key1&quot; ); When the keys are the same, entries are stored on the same member. But we sometimes want to have related entries stored on the same member, such as a customer and his\/her order entries. We would have a customers map with customerId as the key and an orders map with orderId as the key. Since customerId and orderId are different keys, a customer and his\/her orders may fall into different members in your cluster. So how can we have them stored on the same member? We create an affinity between customer and orders. If we make them part of the same partition then these entries will be co-located. We achieve this by making orderIds PartitionAware. public class OrderKey implements Serializable, PartitionAware { private final long customerId; private final long orderId; public OrderKey( long orderId, long customerId ) { this.customerId = customerId; this.orderId = orderId; } public long getCustomerId() { return customerId; } public long getOrderId() { return orderId; } public Object getPartitionKey() { return customerId; } @Override public String toString() { return &quot;OrderKey{&quot; + &quot;customerId=&quot; + customerId + &quot;, orderId=&quot; + orderId + '}'; } } Notice that OrderKey implements PartitionAware and that getPartitionKey() returns the customerId. This will make sure that the Customer entry and its Orders will be stored on the same member. HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Map mapCustomers = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); Map mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;orders&quot; ); \/\/ create the customer entry with customer id = 1 mapCustomers.put( 1, customer ); \/\/ now create the orders for this customer mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 21, 1 ), order ); mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 22, 1 ), order ); mapOrders.put( new OrderKey( 23, 1 ), order ); Assume that you have a customers map where customerId is the key and the customer object is the value. You want to remove one of the customer orders and return the number of remaining orders. Here is how you would normally do it. public static int removeOrder( long customerId, long orderId ) throws Exception { IMap&lt;Long, Customer&gt; mapCustomers = instance.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); IMap mapOrders = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;orders&quot; ); mapCustomers.lock( customerId ); mapOrders.remove( orderId ); Set orders = orderMap.keySet(Predicates.equal( &quot;customerId&quot;, customerId )); mapCustomers.unlock( customerId ); return orders.size(); } There are couple of things you should consider. There are four distributed operations there: lock, remove, keySet, unlock. Can you reduce the number of distributed operations? The customer object may not be that big, but can you not have to pass that object through the wire? Think about a scenario where you set order count to the customer object for fast access, so you should do a get and a put, and as a result, the customer object is passed through the wire twice. Instead, why not move the computation over to the member (JVM) where your customer data resides. Here is how you can do this with distributed executor service. Send a PartitionAware Callable task. Callable does the deletion of the order right there and returns with the remaining order count. Upon completion of the Callable task, return the result (remaining order count). You do not have to wait until the task is completed; since distributed executions are asynchronous, you can do other things in the meantime. Here is some example code. HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); public int removeOrder( long customerId, long orderId ) throws Exception { IExecutorService executorService = hazelcastInstance.getExecutorService( &quot;ExecutorService&quot; ); OrderDeletionTask task = new OrderDeletionTask( customerId, orderId ); Future&lt;Integer&gt; future = executorService.submit( task ); int remainingOrders = future.get(); return remainingOrders; } public static class OrderDeletionTask implements Callable&lt;Integer&gt;, PartitionAware, Serializable { private long customerId; private long orderId; public OrderDeletionTask() { } public OrderDeletionTask(long customerId, long orderId) { this.customerId = customerId; this.orderId = orderId; } @Override public Integer call() { Map&lt;Long, Customer&gt; customerMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;customers&quot; ); IMap&lt;OrderKey, Order&gt; orderMap = hazelcastInstance.getMap( &quot;orders&quot; ); mapCustomers.lock( customerId ); Customer customer = mapCustomers.get( customerId ); Predicate predicate = Predicates.equal( &quot;customerId&quot;, customerId ); Set&lt;OrderKey&gt; orderKeys = orderMap.localKeySet( predicate ); int orderCount = orderKeys.size(); for (OrderKey key : orderKeys) { if (key.orderId == orderId) { orderCount--; orderMap.delete( key ); } } mapCustomers.unlock( customerId ); return orderCount; } @Override public Object getPartitionKey() { return customerId; } } The benefits of doing the same operation with distributed ExecutorService based on the key are: Only one distributed execution (executorService.submit(task)), instead of four. Less data is sent over the wire. Since lock\/update\/unlock cycle is done locally (local to the customer data), lock duration for the Customer entry is much less, thus enabling higher concurrency.","tags":"","url":"Performance\/Data_Affinity.html"},{"title":"Back Pressure","text":"Hazelcast uses operations to make remote calls. For example, a map.get is an operation and a map.put is one operation for the primary and one operation for each of the backups, i.e. map.put is executed for the primary and also for each backup. In most cases, there will be a natural balance between the number of threads performing operations and the number of operations being executed. However, there are two situations where this balance and operations can pile up and eventually lead to Out of Memory Exception (OOME): Asynchronous calls: With async calls, the system may be flooded with the requests. Asynchronous backups: The asynchronous backups may be piling up. To prevent the system from crashing, Hazelcast provides back pressure. Back pressure works by: limiting the number of concurrent operation invocations, periodically making an async backup sync. Member Side Back pressure is disabled by default and you can enable it using the following system property: hazelcast.backpressure.enabled To control the number of concurrent invocations, you can configure the number of invocations allowed per partition using the following system property: hazelcast.backpressure.max.concurrent.invocations.per.partition The default value of this system property is 100. Using a default configuration a system is allowed to have (271 + 1) * 100 = 27200 concurrent invocations (271 partitions + 1 for generic operations). Back pressure is only applied to normal operations. System operations like heart beats and partition migration operations are not influenced by back pressure. 27200 invocations might seem like a lot, but keep in mind that executing a task on IExecutor or acquiring a lock also requires an operation. If the maximum number of invocations has been reached, Hazelcast will automatically apply an exponential back off policy. This gives the system some time to deal with the load. Using the following system property, you can configure the maximum time to wait before a HazelcastOverloadException is thrown: hazelcast.backpressure.backoff.timeout.millis This system property's default value is 60000 ms. The Health Monitor keeps an eye on the usage of the invocations. If it sees a member has consumed 70% or more of the invocations, it starts to log health messages. Apart from controlling the number of invocations, you also need to control the number of pending async backups. This is done by periodically making these backups sync instead of async. This forces all pending backups to get drained. For this, Hazelcast tracks the number of asynchronous backups for each partition. At every Nth call, one synchronization is forced. This N is controlled through the following property: hazelcast.backpressure.syncwindow This system property's default value is 100. It means, out of 100 asynchronous backups, Hazelcast makes 1 of them a synchronous one. A randomization is added, so the sync window with default configuration will be between 75 and 125 invocations. Client Side To prevent the system at the client side from overloading, you can apply a constraint on the number of concurrent invocations. You can use the following system property at the client side for this purpose: hazelcast.client.max.concurrent.invocations This property defines the maximum allowed number of concurrent invocations. When it is not explicitly set, it has the value Integer.MAX_VALUE by default, which means infinite. When you set it and if the maximum number of concurrent invocations is exceeded this value, Hazelcast will throw HazelcastOverloadException when a new invocation comes in. Please note that back off timeout and controlling the number of pending async backups (sync window) is not supported at the client side. RELATED INFORMATION Please refer to the System Properties section to learn how to configure the system properties.","tags":"","url":"Performance\/Back_Pressure.html"},{"title":"I:O Threading","text":"Your application server has its own threads. Hazelcast does not use these; it manages its own threads. I\/O Threading Hazelcast uses a pool of threads for I\/O. A single thread does not perform all the I\/O. Instead, multiple threads perform the I\/O. On each cluster member, the I\/O threading is split up in 3 types of I\/O threads: I\/O thread for the accept requests. I\/O threads to read data from other members\/clients. I\/O threads to write data to other members\/clients. You can configure the number of I\/O threads using the hazelcast.io.thread.count system property. Its default value is 3 per member. If 3 is used, in total there are 7 I\/O threads: 1 accept I\/O thread, 3 read I\/O threads, and 3 write I\/O threads. Each I\/O thread has its own Selector instance and waits on the Selector.select if there is nothing to do. NOTE: You can also specify counts for input and output threads separately. There are hazelcast.io.input.thread.count and hazelcast.io.output.thread.count properties for this purpose. Please refer to the System Properties section for information on these properties and how to set them. Hazelcast periodically scans utilization of each I\/O thread and can decide to migrate a connection to a new thread if the existing thread is servicing a disproportionate number of I\/O events. You can customize the scanning interval by configuring the hazelcast.io.balancer.interval.seconds system property; its default interval is 20 seconds. You can disable the balancing process by setting this property to a negative value. In case of the read I\/O thread, when sufficient bytes for a packet have been received, the Packet object is created. This Packet object is then sent to the system where it is de-multiplexed. If the Packet header signals that it is an operation\/response, the Packet is handed over to the operation service (please see the Operation Threading section). If the Packet is an event, it is handed over to the event service (please see the Event Threading section).","tags":"","url":"Performance\/Threading_Model\/I:O_Threading.html"},{"title":"Event Threading","text":"Hazelcast uses a shared event system to deal with components that rely on events, such as topic, collections, listeners, and Near Cache. Each cluster member has an array of event threads and each thread has its own work queue. When an event is produced, either locally or remotely, an event thread is selected (depending on if there is a message ordering) and the event is placed in the work queue for that event thread. The following properties can be set to alter the behavior of the system. hazelcast.event.thread.count: Number of event-threads in this array. Its default value is 5. hazelcast.event.queue.capacity: Capacity of the work queue. Its default value is 1000000. hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis: Timeout for placing an item on the work queue. Its default value is 250. If you process a lot of events and have many cores, changing the value of hazelcast.event.thread.count property to a higher value is a good practice. This way, more events can be processed in parallel. Multiple components share the same event queues. If there are 2 topics, say A and B, for certain messages they may share the same queue(s) and hence the same event thread. If there are a lot of pending messages produced by A, then B needs to wait. Also, when processing a message from A takes a lot of time and the event thread is used for that, B suffers from this. That is why it is better to offload processing to a dedicated thread (pool) so that systems are better isolated. If the events are produced at a higher rate than they are consumed, the queue grows in size. To prevent overloading the system and running into an OutOfMemoryException, the queue is given a capacity of 1 million items. When the maximum capacity is reached, the items are dropped. This means that the event system is a 'best effort' system. There is no guarantee that you are going to get an event. Topic A might have a lot of pending messages and therefore B cannot receive messages because the queue has no capacity and messages for B are dropped.","tags":"","url":"Performance\/Threading_Model\/Event_Threading.html"},{"title":"IExecutor Threading","text":"Executor threading is straight forward.

Each operation thread has its own work queue and it consumes messages from this work queue. If a partition-aware operation needs to be scheduled, the right thread is found using the formula below. threadIndex = partitionId % partition thread-count After the threadIndex is determined, the operation is put in the work queue of that operation thread. This means the followings: A single operation thread executes operations for multiple partitions; if there are 271 partitions and 10 partition threads, then roughly every operation thread executes operations for 27 partitions. Each partition belongs to only 1 operation thread. All operations for a partition are always handled by exactly the same operation thread. Concurrency control is not needed to deal with partition-aware operations because once a partition-aware operation is put in the work queue of a partition-aware operation thread, only 1 thread is able to touch that partition. Because of this threading strategy, there are two forms of false sharing you need to be aware of: False sharing of the partition - two completely independent data structures share the same partition. For example, if there is a map employees and a map orders, the method employees.get(&quot;peter&quot;) running on partition 25 may be blocked by the method orders.get(1234) also running on partition 25. If independent data structures share the same partition, a slow operation on one data structure can slow down the other data structures. False sharing of the partition-aware operation thread - each operation thread is responsible for executing operations on a number of partitions. For example, thread 1 could be responsible for partitions 0, 10, 20, etc. and thread-2 could be responsible for partitions 1, 11, 21, etc. If an operation for partition 1 takes a lot of time, it blocks the execution of an operation for partition 11 because both of them are mapped to the same operation thread. You need to be careful with long running operations because you could starve operations of a thread. As a general rule, the partition thread should be released as soon as possible because operations are not designed as long running operations. That is why, for example, it is very dangerous to execute a long running operation using AtomicReference.alter() or an IMap.executeOnKey(), because these operations block other operations to be executed. Currently, there is no support for work stealing. Different partitions that map to the same thread may need to wait till one of the partitions is finished, even though there are other free partition-aware operation threads available. Example: Take a cluster with three members. Two members will have 90 primary partitions and one member will have 91 primary partitions. Let's say you have one CPU and four cores per CPU. By default, four operation threads will be allocated to serve 90 or 91 partitions. Operations that are Not Partition-aware To execute operations that are not partition-aware, e.g., IExecutorService.executeOnMember(command, member), generic operation threads are used. When the Hazelcast instance is started, an array of operation threads is created. The size of this array has a default value of the number of cores divided by two with a minimum value of 2. It can be changed using the hazelcast.operation.generic.thread.count property. A non-partition-aware operation thread does not execute an operation for a specific partition. Only partition-aware operation threads execute partition-aware operations. Unlike the partition-aware operation threads, all the generic operation threads share the same work queue: genericWorkQueue. If a non-partition-aware operation needs to be executed, it is placed in that work queue and any generic operation thread can execute it. The big advantage is that you automatically have work balancing since any generic operation thread is allowed to pick up work from this queue. The disadvantage is that this shared queue can be a point of contention. You may not see this contention in production since performance is dominated by I\/O and the system does not run many non-partition-aware operations. Priority Operations In some cases, the system needs to run operations with a higher priority, e.g., an important system operation. To support priority operations, Hazelcast has the following features: For partition-aware operations: Each partition thread has its own work queue and it also has a priority work queue. The partition thread always checks the priority queue before it processes work from its normal work queue. For non-partition-aware operations: Next to the genericWorkQueue, there is also a genericPriorityWorkQueue. When a priority operation needs to be run, it is put in the genericPriorityWorkQueue. Like the partition-aware operation threads, a generic operation thread first checks the genericPriorityWorkQueue for work. Since a worker thread blocks on the normal work queue (either partition specific or generic), a priority operation may not be picked up because it is not put in the queue where it is blocking. Hazelcast always sends a 'kick the worker' operation that only triggers the worker to wake up and check the priority queue. Operation-response and Invocation-future When an Operation is invoked, a Future is returned. Please see the example code below. GetOperation operation = new GetOperation( mapName, key ); Future future = operationService.invoke( operation ); future.get(); The calling side blocks for a reply. In this case, GetOperation is set in the work queue for the partition of key, where it eventually is executed. Upon execution, a response is returned and placed on the genericWorkQueue where it is executed by a &quot;generic operation thread&quot;. This thread signals the future and notifies the blocked thread that a response is available. Hazelcast has a plan of exposing this future to the outside world, and we will provide the ability to register a completion listener so you can perform asynchronous calls. Local Calls When a local partition-aware call is done, an operation is made and handed over to the work queue of the correct partition operation thread, and a future is returned. When the calling thread calls get on that future, it acquires a lock and waits for the result to become available. When a response is calculated, the future is looked up and the waiting thread is notified. In the future, this will be optimized to reduce the amount of expensive systems calls, such as lock.acquire()\/notify() and the expensive interaction with the operation-queue. Probably, we will add support for a caller-runs mode, so that an operation is directly run on the calling thread.","tags":"","url":"Performance\/Threading_Model\/Operation_Threading.html"},{"title":"Slow Operation Detector","text":"The SlowOperationDetector monitors the operation threads and collects information about all slow operations. An Operation is a task executed by a generic or partition thread (see Operation Threading). An operation is considered as slow when it takes more computation time than the configured threshold.

Hazelcast clients do not have local data at all. Suppose you read the key k a number of times from a Hazelcast client or k is owned by another member in your cluster. Then each map.get(k) or cache.get(k) will be a remote operation, which creates a lot of network trips. If you have a data structure that is mostly read, then you should consider creating a local Near Cache, so that reads are sped up and less network traffic is created. These benefits do not come for free, please consider the following trade-offs: Members with a Near Cache will have to hold the extra cached data, which increases memory consumption. If invalidation is enabled and entries are updated frequently, then invalidations will be costly. Near Cache breaks the strong consistency guarantees; you might be reading stale data. Near Cache is highly recommended for data structures that are mostly read. In a client\/server system you must enable the Near Cache separately on the client, without the need to configure it on the server. Please note that Near Cache configuration is specific to the server or client itself: a data structure on a server may not have Near Cache configured while the same data structure on a client may have Near Cache configured. They also can have different Near Cache configurations. If you are using Near Cache, you should take into account that your hits to the keys in the Near Cache are not reflected as hits to the original keys on the primary members. This has for example an impact on IMap's maximum idle seconds or time-to-live seconds expiration. Therefore, even though there is a hit on a key in Near Cache, your original key on the primary member may expire.

OBJECT: Data will be stored in deserialized form. NATIVE: Data will be stored in the Near Cache that uses Hazelcast's High-Density Memory Store feature. This option is available only in Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD. Note that a map and its Near Cache can independently use High-Density Memory Store. For example, while your map does not use High-Density Memory Store, its Near Cache can use it. invalidate-on-change: Specifies whether the cached entries are evicted when the entries are updated or removed. Its default value is true. time-to-live-seconds: Maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in the Near Cache. Entries that are older than this period are automatically evicted from the Near Cache. Regardless of the eviction policy used, time-to-live-seconds still applies. Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means infinite. Its default value is 0. max-idle-seconds: Maximum number of seconds each entry can stay in the Near Cache as untouched (not read). Entries that are not read more than this period are removed from the Near Cache. Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means Integer.MAX_VALUE. Its default value is 0. eviction: Specifies the eviction behavior when you use High-Density Memory Store for your Near Cache. It has the following attributes: eviction-policy: Eviction policy configuration. Available values are as follows: LRU: Least Recently Used (default value). LFU: Least Frequently Used. NONE: No items will be evicted and the property max-size will be ignored. You still can combine it with time-to-live-seconds and max-idle-seconds to evict items from the Near Cache. RANDOM: A random item will be evicted. max-size-policy: Maximum size policy for eviction of the Near Cache. Available values are as follows: ENTRY_COUNT: Maximum size based on the entry count in the Near Cache (default value). USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE: Maximum used native memory size of the specified Near Cache in MB to trigger the eviction. If the used native memory size exceeds this threshold, the eviction is triggered. Available only for NATIVE in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise. USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE: Maximum used native memory percentage of the specified Near Cache to trigger the eviction. If the native memory usage percentage (relative to maximum native memory size) exceeds this threshold, the eviction is triggered. Available only for NATIVE in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise. FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE: Minimum free native memory size of the specified Near Cache in MB to trigger the eviction. If free native memory size goes below this threshold, eviction is triggered. Available only for NATIVE in-memory format. This is supported only by Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise. FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE: Minimum free native memory percentage of the specified Near Cache to trigger eviction.

Any integer between 1 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. This value has different defaults, depending on the data structure. IMap: Its default value is Integer.MAX_VALUE for on-heap maps and 10000 for the NATIVE in-memory format. JCache: Its default value is 10000. cache-local-entries: Specifies whether the local entries will be cached. It can be useful when in-memory format for Near Cache is different from that of the map.

Is just available on JCache clients. Available values are as follows: INVALIDATE: Does not update the local Near Cache. Will invalidate the local Near Cache eventually (default value). CACHE_ON_UPDATE: Updates the local Near Cache immediately after the put operation completes. preloader: Specifies if the Near Cache should store and pre-load its keys for a faster re-population after a Hazelcast client restart. Is just available on IMap and JCache clients. It has the following attributes: enabled: Specifies whether the preloader for this Near Cache is enabled or not, true or false. directory: Specifies the parent directory for the preloader of this Near Cache. The filenames for the preloader storage will be generated from the Near Cache name. You can additionally specify the parent directory to have multiple clients on the same machine with the same Near Cache names. store-initial-delay-seconds: Specifies the delay in seconds until the keys of this Near Cache are stored for the first time.

Near Cache invalidation happens asynchronously at the cluster level, but synchronously at the current member. This means that the Near Cache is invalidated within the whole cluster after the modifying operation is finished, but updated from the current member before the modifying operation is done. A modifying operation can be an EntryProcessor, an explicit update or remove as well as an expiration or eviction. Generally, whenever the state of an entry changes in the record store by updating its value or removing it, the invalidation event is sent for that entry. Invalidations can be sent from members to client Near Caches or to member Near Caches, either individually or in batches. Default behavior is sending in batches. If there are lots of mutating operations such as put\/remove on data structures, it is advised that you configure batch invalidations. This reduces the network traffic and keeps the eventing system less busy, but may increase the delay of individual invalidations. You can use the following system properties to configure the Near Cache invalidation: hazelcast.map.invalidation.batch.enabled: Enable or disable batching. Default value is true.

Below is an example of declarative configuration of WAN Replication from New York cluster to target the London cluster: &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;wan-replication name=&quot;my-wan-cluster-batch&quot;&gt; &lt;wan-publisher group-name=&quot;london&quot;&gt; &lt;class-name&gt;com.hazelcast.enterprise.wan.replication.WanBatchReplication&lt;\/class-name&gt; &lt;queue-full-behavior&gt;THROW_EXCEPTION&lt;\/queue-full-behavior&gt; &lt;queue-capacity&gt;1000&lt;\/queue-capacity&gt; &lt;properties&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;batch.size&quot;&gt;500&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;batch.max.delay.millis&quot;&gt;1000&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;snapshot.enabled&quot;&gt;false&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;response.timeout.millis&quot;&gt;60000&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;ack.type&quot;&gt;ACK_ON_OPERATION_COMPLETE&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;endpoints&quot;&gt;10.3.5.1:5701, 10.3.5.2:5701&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;group.password&quot;&gt;london-pass&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;\/properties&gt; &lt;\/wan-publisher&gt; &lt;\/wan-replication&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; Following are the definitions of configuration elements: name: Name of your WAN Replication. This name is referenced in IMap or ICache configuration when you add WAN Replication for these data structures (using the element in the configuration of IMap or ICache). group-name: Configures target cluster's group name. class-name: Name of the class implementation for the WAN replication. queue-full-behavior: Policy to be applied when WAN Replication event queues are full. queue-capacity: Size of the queue of events. Its default value is 10000. batch.size: Maximum size of events that are sent to the target cluster in a single batch. batch.max.delay.millis: Maximum amount of time to be waited before sending a batch of events in case batch.size is not reached. snapshot.enabled: When set to true, only the latest events (based on key) are selected and sent in a batch. response.timeout.millis: Time in milliseconds to be waited for the acknowledgment of a sent WAN event to target cluster. ack.type: Acknowledgment type for each target cluster. endpoints: IP addresses of the cluster members for which the WAN replication is implemented. group.password: Configures target cluster's group password. And the following is the equivalent programmatic configuration snippet: Config config = new Config(); WanReplicationConfig wrConfig = new WanReplicationConfig(); WanPublisherConfig publisherConfig = wrConfig.getWanPublisherConfig(); wrConfig.setName(&quot;my-wan-cluster-batch&quot;); publisherConfig.setGroupName(&quot;london&quot;); publisherConfig.setClassName(&quot;com.hazelcast.enterprise.wan.replication.WanBatchReplication&quot;); Map&lt;String, Comparable&gt; props = publisherConfig.getProperties(); props.put(&quot;group.password&quot;, &quot;london-pass&quot;); props.put(&quot;snapshot.enabled&quot;, false); props.put(&quot;endpoints&quot;, &quot;10.3.5.1:5701,10.3.5.2:5701&quot;); config.addWanReplicationConfig(wrConfig); Using this configuration, the cluster running in New York will replicate to Tokyo and London. The Tokyo and London clusters should have similar configurations if you want to run in Active-Active mode. If the New York and London cluster configurations contain the wan-replication element and the Tokyo cluster does not, it means New York and London are active endpoints and Tokyo is a passive endpoint. WanBatchReplication Implementation Hazelcast offers WanBatchReplication implementation for the WAN replication. As you see in the above configuration examples, this implementation is configured using the class-name element (in the declarative configuration) or the method setClassName (in the programmatic configuration). The implementation WanBatchReplication waits until: a pre-defined number of replication events are generated, (please refer to the Batch Size section). or a pre-defined amount of time is passed (please refer to the Batch Maximum Delay section).

To enable WAN replication for an IMap or ICache instance, you can use the wan-replication-ref element. Each IMap and ICache instance can have different WAN replication configurations. Enabling WAN Replication for IMap: Imagine you have different distributed maps, however only one of those maps should be replicated to a target cluster. To achieve this, configure the map that you want replicated by adding the wan-replication-ref element in the map configuration as shown below. &lt;hazelcast&gt; &lt;wan-replication name=&quot;my-wan-cluster&quot;&gt; ... &lt;\/wan-replication&gt; &lt;map name=&quot;my-shared-map&quot;&gt; &lt;wan-replication-ref name=&quot;my-wan-cluster&quot;&gt; &lt;merge-policy&gt;com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy&lt;\/merge-policy&gt; &lt;republishing-enabled&gt;false&lt;\/republishing-enabled&gt; &lt;\/wan-replication-ref&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; The following is the equivalent programmatic configuration: Config config = new Config(); WanReplicationConfig wrConfig = new WanReplicationConfig(); WanTargetClusterConfig wtcConfig = wrConfig.getWanTargetClusterConfig(); wrConfig.setName(&quot;my-wan-cluster&quot;); ... config.addWanReplicationConfig(wrConfig); WanReplicationRef wanRef = new WanReplicationRef(); wanRef.setName(&quot;my-wan-cluster&quot;); wanRef.setMergePolicy(PassThroughMergePolicy.class.getName()); wanRef.setRepublishingEnabled(false); config.getMapConfig(&quot;my-shared-map&quot;).setWanReplicationRef(wanRef); You see that we have my-shared-map configured to replicate itself to the cluster targets defined in the earlier wan-replication element. wan-replication-ref has the following elements; name: Name of wan-replication configuration. IMap or ICache instance uses this wan-replication configuration. merge-policy: Resolve conflicts that are occurred when target cluster already has the replicated entry key. republishing-enabled: When enabled, an incoming event to a member is forwarded to target cluster of that member. Enabling the event republishing is useful in a scenario where cluster A replicates to cluster B, and cluster B replicates to cluster C. You do not need to enable republishing when all your clusters replicate to each other. When using Active-Active Replication, multiple clusters can simultaneously update the same entry in a distributed data structure. You can configure a merge policy to resolve these potential conflicts, as shown in the above example configuration (using the merge-policy sub-element under the wan-replication-ref element). Hazelcast provides the following merge policies for IMap: com.hazelcast.map.merge.PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy: Incoming entry merges from the source map to the target map if it does not exist in the target map. com.hazelcast.map.merge.HigherHitsMapMergePolicy: Incoming entry merges from the source map to the target map if the source entry has more hits than the target one. com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy: Incoming entry merges from the source map to the target map unless the incoming entry is not null. com.hazelcast.map.merge.LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy: Incoming entry merges from the source map to the target map if the source entry has been updated more recently than the target entry. Please note that this merge policy can only be used when the clusters' clocks are in sync. NOTE: When using WAN replication, please note that only key based events are replicated to the target cluster. Operations like clear, destroy and evictAll are NOT replicated.

OSGI Support Hazelcast bundles provide OSGI services so that Hazelcast users can manage (create, access, shutdown) Hazelcast instances through these services on OSGI environments. When you enable the property hazelcast.osgi.start (default is disabled), when an Hazelcast OSGI service is activated, a default Hazelcast instance is created automatically. Created Hazelcast instances can be served as an OSGI service that the other Hazelcast bundles can access. Registering created Hazelcast instances behavior is enabled by default; you can disable it using the property hazelcast.osgi.register.disabled. Each Hazelcast bundle provides a different OSGI service. Their instances can be grouped (clustered) together to prevent possible compatibility issues between different Hazelcast versions\/bundles. This grouping behavior is enabled by default and you disable it using the property hazelcast.osgi.grouping.disabled. Hazelcast OSGI service's lifecycle (and the owned\/created instances's lifecycles) is the same with the owner Hazelcast bundles. When the bundle is stopped (deactivated), the owned service and Hazelcast instances are also deactivated\/shutdown and deregistered automatically. When the bundle is re-activated, its service is registered again. The Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise JAR package is also an OSGI bundle like the Hazelcast Open Source JAR package. API HazelcastOSGiService: Contract point for Hazelcast services on top of OSGI. Registered to org.osgi.framework.BundleContext as the OSGI service so the other bundles can access and use Hazelcast on the OSGI environment through this service. HazelcastOSGiInstance: Contract point for HazelcastInstance implementations based on OSGI service. HazelcastOSGiService provides proxy Hazelcast instances typed HazelcastOSGiInstance which is a subtype of HazelcastInstance and these instances delegate all calls to the underlying HazelcastInstance. Configuring Hazelcast OSGI Support HazelcastOSGiService uses three configurations: hazelcast.osgi.start: If this property is enabled (it is disabled by default), when an HazelcastOSGiService is activated, a default Hazelcast instance is created automatically. hazelcast.osgi.register.disabled: If this property is disabled (it is disabled by default), when a Hazelcast instance is created by HazelcastOSGiService, the created HazelcastOSGiInstance is registered automatically as OSGI service with type of HazelcastOSGiInstance and it is deregistered automatically when the created HazelcastOSGiInstance is shutdown. hazelcast.osgi.grouping.disabled: If this property is disabled (it is disabled by default), every created HazelcastOSGiInstance is grouped as their owner HazelcastOSGiService and do not join each other unless no group name is specified in the GroupConfig of Config. Design HazelcastOSGiService is specific to each Hazelcast bundle. This means that every Hazelcast bundle has its own HazelcastOSGiService instance. Every Hazelcast bundle registers its HazelcastOSGiService instances via Hazelcast Bundle Activator (com.hazelcast.osgi.impl.Activator) while they are being started, and it deregisters its HazelcastOSGiService instances while they are being stopped. Each HazelcastOSGiService instance has a different service ID as the combination of Hazelcast version and artifact type (OSS or EE). Examples are 3.6#OSS, 3.6#EE, 3.7#OSS, 3.7#EE, etc. HazelcastOSGiService instance lifecycle is the same with the owner Hazelcast bundle. This means that when the owner bundle is deactivated, the owned HazelcastOSGiService instance is deactivated, and all active Hazelcast instances that are created and served by that HazelcastOSGiService instance are also shutdown and deregistered. When the Hazelcast bundle is re-activated, its HazelcastOSGiService instance is registered again as the OSGI service. Getting Hazelcast OSGI Service Instances You can access all HazelcastOSGiService instances through org.osgi.framework.BundleContext for each Hazelcast bundle as follows: for (ServiceReference serviceRef : context.getServiceReferences(HazelcastOSGiService.class.getName(), null)) { HazelcastOSGiService service = (HazelcastOSGiService) context.getService(serviceRef); String serviceId = service.getId(); ... } Managing and Using Hazelcast instances You can use HazelcastOSGiService instance to create and shutdown Hazelcast instances on OSGI environments. The created Hazelcast instances are HazelcastOSGiInstance typed (which is sub-type of HazelcastInstance) and are just proxies to the underlying Hazelcast instance. There are several methods in HazelcastOSGiService to use Hazelcast instances on OSGI environments as shown below. \/\/ Get the default Hazelcast instance owned by `hazelcastOsgiService` \/\/ Returns null if `HAZELCAST_OSGI_START` is not enabled HazelcastOSGiInstance defaultInstance = hazelcastOsgiService.getDefaultHazelcastInstance(); \/\/ Creates a new Hazelcast instance with default configurations as owned by `hazelcastOsgiService` HazelcastOSGiInstance newInstance1 = hazelcastOsgiService.newHazelcastInstance(); \/\/ Creates a new Hazelcast instance with specified configuration as owned by `hazelcastOsgiService` Config config = new Config(); config.setInstanceName(&quot;OSGI-Instance&quot;); ...

The com.hazelcast.spi.ManagedService source code is here. CounterService implements the following methods. init: This is called when CounterService is initialized. NodeEngine enables access to Hazelcast internals such as HazelcastInstance and PartitionService.

Now, let's connect the Counter interface to CounterService and perform a remote call to the cluster member hosting the counter data. Then, we will return a dummy result. Remote calls are performed via a proxy in Hazelcast. Proxies expose the methods at the client side. Once a method is called, proxy creates an operation object, sends this object to the cluster member responsible from executing that operation, and then sends the result. Making Counter a Distributed Object First, we need to make the Counter interface a distributed object by extending the DistributedObject interface, as shown below. import com.hazelcast.core.DistributedObject; public interface Counter extends DistributedObject { int inc(int amount); } Implementing ManagedService and RemoteService Now, we need to make the CounterService class implement not only the ManagedService interface, but also the interface com.hazelcast.spi.RemoteService. This way, a client will be able to get a handle of a counter proxy. You can read the source code for RemoteService here. import com.hazelcast.core.DistributedObject; import com.hazelcast.spi.ManagedService; import com.hazelcast.spi.NodeEngine; import com.hazelcast.spi.RemoteService; import java.util.Properties; public class CounterService implements ManagedService, RemoteService { public static final String NAME = &quot;CounterService&quot;; private NodeEngine nodeEngine; @Override public DistributedObject createDistributedObject(String objectName) { return new CounterProxy(objectName, nodeEngine, this); } @Override public void destroyDistributedObject(String objectName) { \/\/ for the time being a no-op, but in the later examples this will be implemented } @Override public void init(NodeEngine nodeEngine, Properties properties) { this.nodeEngine = nodeEngine; } @Override public void shutdown(boolean terminate) { } @Override public void reset() { } } The CounterProxy returned by the method createDistributedObject is a local representation to (potentially) remote managed data and logic. NOTE: Note that caching and removing the proxy instance are done outside of this service. Implementing CounterProxy Now, it is time to implement the CounterProxy as shown below. CounterProxy extends AbstractDistributedObject, source code here. import com.hazelcast.spi.AbstractDistributedObject; import com.hazelcast.spi.InvocationBuilder; import com.hazelcast.spi.NodeEngine; import com.hazelcast.util.ExceptionUtil; import java.util.concurrent.Future; public class CounterProxy extends AbstractDistributedObject&lt;CounterService&gt; implements Counter { private final String name; public CounterProxy(String name, NodeEngine nodeEngine, CounterService counterService) { super(nodeEngine, counterService); this.name = name; } @Override public String getServiceName() { return CounterService.NAME; } @Override public String getName() { return name; } @Override public int inc(int amount) { NodeEngine nodeEngine = getNodeEngine(); IncOperation operation = new IncOperation(name, amount); int partitionId = nodeEngine.getPartitionService().getPartitionId(name); InvocationBuilder builder = nodeEngine.getOperationService() .createInvocationBuilder(CounterService.NAME, operation, partitionId); try { final Future&lt;Integer&gt; future = builder.invoke(); return future.get(); } catch (Exception e) { throw ExceptionUtil.rethrow(e); } } } CounterProxy is a local representation of remote data\/functionality. It does not include the counter state. Therefore, the method inc should be invoked on the cluster member hosting the real counter. You can invoke it using Hazelcast SPI; then it will send the operations to the correct member and return the results. Let's dig deeper into the method inc. First, we create IncOperation with a given name and amount. Then, we get the partition ID based on the name; by this way, all operations for a given name will result in the same partition ID. Then, we create an InvocationBuilder where the connection between operation and partition is made. Finally, we invoke the InvocationBuilder and wait for its result. This waiting is performed with a future.get(). In our case, timeout is not important. However, it is a good practice to use a timeout for a real system since operations should complete in a certain amount of time. Dealing with Exceptions Hazelcast's ExceptionUtil is a good solution when it comes to dealing with execution exceptions. When the execution of the operation fails with an exception, an ExecutionException is thrown and handled with the method ExceptionUtil.rethrow(Throwable). If it is an InterruptedException, we have two options: either propagate the exception or just use the ExceptionUtil.rethrow for all exceptions. Please see the example code below. try { final Future&lt;Integer&gt; future = invocation.invoke(); return future.get(); } catch(InterruptedException e){ throw e; } catch(Exception e){ throw ExceptionUtil.rethrow(e); } Implementing the PartitionAwareOperation Interface Now, let's write the IncOperation. It implements the PartitionAwareOperation interface, meaning that it will be executed on the partition that hosts the counter. See the PartitionAwareOperation source code here. The method run does the actual execution. Since IncOperation will return a response, the method returnsResponse returns true. If your method is asynchronous and does not need to return a response, it is better to return false since it will be faster. The actual response is stored in the field returnValue; retrieve it with the method getResponse. There are two more methods in this code: writeInternal and readInternal. Since IncOperation needs to be serialized, these two methods are overridden, and hence, objectId and amount are serialized and available when those operations are executed. For the deserialization, note that the operation must have a no-arg constructor. import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataInput; import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataOutput; import com.hazelcast.spi.Operation; import com.hazelcast.spi.PartitionAwareOperation; import java.io.IOException; class IncOperation extends Operation implements PartitionAwareOperation { private String objectId; private int amount, returnValue; \/\/ Important to have a no-arg constructor for deserialization public IncOperation() { } public IncOperation(String objectId, int amount) { this.amount = amount; this.objectId = objectId; } @Override public void run() throws Exception { System.out.println(&quot;Executing &quot; + objectId + &quot;.inc() on: &quot; + getNodeEngine().getThisAddress()); returnValue = 0; } @Override public Object getResponse() { return returnValue; } @Override protected void writeInternal(ObjectDataOutput out) throws IOException { super.writeInternal(out); out.writeUTF(objectId); out.writeInt(amount); } @Override protected void readInternal(ObjectDataInput in) throws IOException { super.readInternal(in); objectId = in.readUTF(); amount = in.readInt(); } } Running the Code Now, let's run our code. import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; import java.util.UUID; public class Member { public static void main(String[] args) { HazelcastInstance[] instances = new HazelcastInstance[2]; for (int k = 0; k &lt; instances.length; k++) instances[k] = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Counter[] counters = new Counter[4]; for (int k = 0; k &lt; counters.length; k++) counters[k] = instances[0].getDistributedObject(CounterService.NAME, k+&quot;counter&quot;); for (Counter counter : counters) System.out.println(counter.inc(1)); System.out.println(&quot;Finished&quot;); System.exit(0); } } Once run, you will see the output as below. Executing 0counter.inc() on: Address[192.168.1.103]:5702 0 Executing 1counter.inc() on: Address[192.168.1.103]:5702 0 Executing 2counter.inc() on: Address[192.168.1.103]:5701 0 Executing 3counter.inc() on: Address[192.168.1.103]:5701 0 Finished Note that counters are stored in different cluster members. Also note that increment is not active for now since the value remains as 0. Until now, we have performed the basics to get this up and running. In the next section, we will make a real counter, cache the proxy instances and deal with proxy instance destruction.","tags":"","url":"Extending_Hazelcast\/User_Defined_Services\/Placing_a_Remote_Call_via_Proxy.html"},{"title":"Creating Containers","text":"Let's create a Container for every partition in the system. This container will contain all counters and proxies. import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; class Container { private final Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; values = new HashMap(); int inc(String id, int amount) { Integer counter = values.get(id); if (counter == null) { counter = 0; } counter += amount; values.put(id, counter); return counter; } public void init(String objectName) { values.put(objectName,0); } public void destroy(String objectName) { values.remove(objectName); } ... } Hazelcast guarantees that a single thread will be active in a single partition. Therefore, when accessing a container, concurrency control will not be an issue. The code in our example uses a Container instance per partition approach. With this approach, there will not be any mutable shared state between partitions. This approach also makes operations on partitions simpler since you do not need to filter out data that does not belong to a certain partition. The code performs the tasks below. It creates a container for every partition with the method init. It creates the proxy with the method createDistributedObject. It removes the value of the object with the method destroyDistributedObject, otherwise we may get an OutOfMemory exception. Integrating the Container in the CounterService Let's integrate the Container in the CounterService, as shown below. import com.hazelcast.spi.ManagedService; import com.hazelcast.spi.NodeEngine; import com.hazelcast.spi.RemoteService; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import java.util.Properties; public class CounterService implements ManagedService, RemoteService { public final static String NAME = &quot;CounterService&quot;; Container[] containers; private NodeEngine nodeEngine; @Override public void init(NodeEngine nodeEngine, Properties properties) { this.nodeEngine = nodeEngine; containers = new Container[nodeEngine.getPartitionService().getPartitionCount()]; for (int k = 0; k &lt; containers.length; k++) containers[k] = new Container(); } @Override public void shutdown(boolean terminate) { } @Override public CounterProxy createDistributedObject(String objectName) { int partitionId = nodeEngine.getPartitionService().getPartitionId(objectName); Container container = containers[partitionId]; container.init(objectName); return new CounterProxy(objectName, nodeEngine, this); } @Override public void destroyDistributedObject(String objectName) { int partitionId = nodeEngine.getPartitionService().getPartitionId(objectName); Container container = containers[partitionId]; container.destroy(objectName); } @Override public void reset() { } public static class Container { final Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; values = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;(); private void init(String objectName) { values.put(objectName, 0); } private void destroy(String objectName){ values.remove(objectName); } } } Connecting the IncOperation.run Method to the Container As the last step in creating a Container, we connect the method IncOperation.run to the Container, as shown below. partitionId has a range between 0 and partitionCount and can be used as an index for the container array. Therefore, you can use partitionId to retrieve the container, and once the container has been retrieved, you can access the value. import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataInput; import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataOutput; import com.hazelcast.spi.Operation; import com.hazelcast.spi.PartitionAwareOperation; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.Map; class IncOperation extends Operation implements PartitionAwareOperation { private String objectId; private int amount, returnValue; public IncOperation() { } public IncOperation(String objectId, int amount) { this.amount = amount; this.objectId = objectId; } @Override public void run() throws Exception { System.out.println(&quot;Executing &quot; + objectId + &quot;.inc() on: &quot; + getNodeEngine().getThisAddress()); CounterService service = getService(); CounterService.Container container = service.containers[getPartitionId()]; Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; valuesMap = container.values; Integer counter = valuesMap.get(objectId); counter += amount; valuesMap.put(objectId, counter); returnValue = counter; } @Override public Object getResponse() { return returnValue; } @Override protected void writeInternal(ObjectDataOutput out) throws IOException { super.writeInternal(out); out.writeUTF(objectId); out.writeInt(amount); } @Override protected void readInternal(ObjectDataInput in) throws IOException { super.readInternal(in); objectId = in.readUTF(); amount = in.readInt(); } } Running the Sample Code Let's run the following sample code. import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; public class Member { public static void main(String[] args) { HazelcastInstance[] instances = new HazelcastInstance[2]; for (int k = 0; k &lt; instances.length; k++) instances[k] = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Counter[] counters = new Counter[4]; for (int k = 0; k &lt; counters.length; k++) counters[k] = instances[0].getDistributedObject(CounterService.NAME, k+&quot;counter&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Round 1&quot;); for (Counter counter: counters) System.out.println(counter.inc(1)); System.out.println(&quot;Round 2&quot;); for (Counter counter: counters) System.out.println(counter.inc(1)); System.out.println(&quot;Finished&quot;); System.exit(0); } } The output will be as follows.

Now, we need to make sure that the content of the partition containers is migrated to different cluster members when a member joins or leaves the cluster. To make this happen, first we need to add three new methods (applyMigrationData, toMigrationData and clear) to the Container. toMigrationData: This method is called when Hazelcast wants to start the partition migration from the member owning the partition. The result of the toMigrationData method is the partition data in a form that can be serialized to another member. applyMigrationData: This method is called when migrationData (created by the method toMigrationData) will be applied to the member that will be the new partition owner. clear: This method is called when the partition migration is successfully completed and the old partition owner gets rid of all data in the partition. This method is also called when the partition migration operation fails and the to-be-the-new partition owner needs to roll back its changes. import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; class Container { private final Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; values = new HashMap(); int inc(String id, int amount) { Integer counter = values.get(id); if (counter == null) { counter = 0; } counter += amount; values.put(id, counter); return counter; } void clear() { values.clear(); } void applyMigrationData(Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; migrationData) { values.putAll(migrationData); } Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; toMigrationData() { return new HashMap(values); } public void init(String objectName) { values.put(objectName,0); } public void destroy(String objectName) { values.remove(objectName); } } Transferring migrationData After you add these three methods to the Container, you need to create a CounterMigrationOperation class that transfers migrationData from one member to another and calls the method applyMigrationData on the correct partition of the new partition owner. An example is shown below. import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataInput; import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataOutput; import com.hazelcast.spi.Operation; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class CounterMigrationOperation extends Operation { Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; migrationData; public CounterMigrationOperation() { } public CounterMigrationOperation(Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; migrationData) { this.migrationData = migrationData; } @Override public void run() throws Exception { CounterService service = getService(); Container container = service.containers[getPartitionId()]; container.applyMigrationData(migrationData); } @Override protected void writeInternal(ObjectDataOutput out) throws IOException { out.writeInt(migrationData.size()); for (Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; entry : migrationData.entrySet()) { out.writeUTF(entry.getKey()); out.writeInt(entry.getValue()); } } @Override protected void readInternal(ObjectDataInput in) throws IOException { int size = in.readInt(); migrationData = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) migrationData.put(in.readUTF(), in.readInt()); } } NOTE: During a partition migration, no other operations are executed on the related partition. Letting Hazelcast Know CounterService Can Do Partition Migrations We need to make our CounterService class implement the MigrationAwareService interface. This will let Hazelcast know that the CounterService can perform partition migration. With the MigrationAwareService interface, some additional methods are exposed. For example, the method prepareMigrationOperation returns all the data of the partition that is going to be moved. You can read the MigrationAwareService source code here. The method commitMigration commits the data, meaning that in this case, it clears the partition container of the old owner. import com.hazelcast.core.DistributedObject; import com.hazelcast.partition.MigrationEndpoint; import com.hazelcast.spi.*; import java.util.Map; import java.util.Properties; public class CounterService implements ManagedService, RemoteService, MigrationAwareService { public final static String NAME = &quot;CounterService&quot;; Container[] containers; private NodeEngine nodeEngine; @Override public void init(NodeEngine nodeEngine, Properties properties) { this.nodeEngine = nodeEngine; containers = new Container[nodeEngine.getPartitionService().getPartitionCount()]; for (int k = 0; k &lt; containers.length; k++) containers[k] = new Container(); } @Override public void shutdown(boolean terminate) { } @Override public DistributedObject createDistributedObject(String objectName) { int partitionId = nodeEngine.getPartitionService().getPartitionId(objectName); Container container = containers[partitionId]; container.init(objectName); return new CounterProxy(objectName, nodeEngine,this); } @Override public void destroyDistributedObject(String objectName) { int partitionId = nodeEngine.getPartitionService().getPartitionId(objectName); Container container = containers[partitionId]; container.destroy(objectName); } @Override public void beforeMigration(PartitionMigrationEvent e) { \/\/no-op } @Override public void clearPartitionReplica(int partitionId) { Container container = containers[partitionId]; container.clear(); } @Override public Operation prepareReplicationOperation(PartitionReplicationEvent e) { if (e.getReplicaIndex() &gt; 1) { return null; } Container container = containers[e.getPartitionId()]; Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; data = container.toMigrationData(); return data.isEmpty() ? null : new CounterMigrationOperation(data); } @Override public void commitMigration(PartitionMigrationEvent e) { if (e.getMigrationEndpoint() == MigrationEndpoint.SOURCE) { Container c = containers[e.getPartitionId()]; c.clear(); } \/\/todo } @Override public void rollbackMigration(PartitionMigrationEvent e) { if (e.getMigrationEndpoint() == MigrationEndpoint.DESTINATION) { Container c = containers[e.getPartitionId()]; c.clear(); } } @Override public void reset() { } } Running the Sample Code We can run the following code. import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast; import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance; public class Member { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance[] instances = new HazelcastInstance[3]; for (int k = 0; k &lt; instances.length; k++) instances[k] = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Counter[] counters = new Counter[4]; for (int k = 0; k &lt; counters.length; k++) counters[k] = instances[0].getDistributedObject(CounterService.NAME, k + &quot;counter&quot;); for (Counter counter : counters) System.out.println(counter.inc(1)); Thread.sleep(10000); System.out.println(&quot;Creating new members&quot;); for (int k = 0; k &lt; 3; k++) { Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); } Thread.sleep(10000); for (Counter counter : counters) System.out.println(counter.inc(1)); System.out.println(&quot;Finished&quot;); System.exit(0); } } And we get the following output.

See the following code. class IncOperation extends Operation implements PartitionAwareOperation, BackupAwareOperation { ... @Override public int getAsyncBackupCount() { return 0; } @Override public int getSyncBackupCount() { return 1; } @Override public boolean shouldBackup() { return true; } @Override public Operation getBackupOperation() { return new IncBackupOperation(objectId, amount); } } The methods getAsyncBackupCount and getSyncBackupCount specify the count for asynchronous and synchronous backups. Our sample has one synchronous backup and no asynchronous backups. In the above code, counts of the backups are hard-coded, but they can also be passed to IncOperation as parameters. The method shouldBackup specifies whether our Operation needs a backup or not. For our sample, it returns true, meaning the Operation will always have a backup even if there are no changes. Of course, in real systems, we want to have backups if there is a change. For IncOperation for example, having a backup when amount is null would be a good practice. The method getBackupOperation returns the operation (IncBackupOperation) that actually performs the backup creation; the backup itself is an operation and will run on the same infrastructure. If a backup should be made and getSyncBackupCount returns 3, then three IncBackupOperation instances are created and sent to the three machines containing the backup partition. If fewer machines are available, then backups need to be created. Hazelcast will just send a smaller number of operations. Performing the Backup with IncBackupOperation Now, let's have a look at the IncBackupOperation. It implements BackupOperation, you can see the source code for BackupOperation here. public class IncBackupOperation extends Operation implements BackupOperation { private String objectId; private int amount; public IncBackupOperation() { } public IncBackupOperation(String objectId, int amount) { this.amount = amount; this.objectId = objectId; } @Override protected void writeInternal(ObjectDataOutput out) throws IOException { super.writeInternal(out); out.writeUTF(objectId); out.writeInt(amount); } @Override protected void readInternal(ObjectDataInput in) throws IOException { super.readInternal(in); objectId = in.readUTF(); amount = in.readInt(); } @Override public void run() throws Exception { CounterService service = getService(); System.out.println(&quot;Executing backup &quot; + objectId + &quot;.inc() on: &quot; + getNodeEngine().getThisAddress()); Container c = service.containers[getPartitionId()]; c.inc(objectId, amount); } } NOTE: Hazelcast will also make sure that a new IncOperation for that particular key will not be executed before the (synchronous) backup operation has completed. Running the Sample Code Let's see the backup functionality in action with the following code. public class Member { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { HazelcastInstance[] instances = new HazelcastInstance[2]; for (int k = 0; k &lt; instances.length; k++) instances[k] = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); Counter counter = instances[0].getDistributedObject(CounterService.NAME, &quot;counter&quot;); counter.inc(1); System.out.println(&quot;Finished&quot;); System.exit(0); } } Once it is run, the following output will be seen. Executing counter0.inc() on: Address[192.168.1.103]:5702 Executing backup counter0.inc() on: Address[192.168.1.103]:5701 Finished As it can be seen, both IncOperation and IncBackupOperation are executed.

You can see the WaitNotifyService source code here. WaitNotifyService keeps a list of waiters. For each notify operation: it looks for a waiter, it asks the waiter whether it wants to keep waiting, if the waiter responds no, the service executes its registered operation (operation itself knows where to send a response), it rinses and repeats until a waiter wants to keep waiting. Each waiter can sit on a wait-notify queue for, at most, its operation's call timeout. For example, by default, each waiter can wait here for at most 1 minute. A continuous task scans expired\/timed-out waiters and invalidates them with CallTimeoutException. Each waiter on the remote side should retry and keep waiting if it still wants to wait. This is a liveness check for remote waiters. This way, it is possible to distinguish an unresponsive member and a long (~infinite) wait. On the caller side, if the waiting thread does not get a response for either a call timeout or for more than 2 times the call-timeout, it will exit with OperationTimeoutException.

Commonly used, especially with development, is the Multicast discovery. This sends out a multicast request to a network segment and awaits other members to answer with their IP addresses. In addition, Hazelcast supports fixed IP addresses: JClouds or AWS (Amazon EC2) based discoveries. Since there is an ever growing number of public and private cloud environments, as well as numerous Service Discovery systems in the wild, Hazelcast provides cloud or service discovery vendors with the option to implement their own discovery strategy. Over the course of this section, we will build a simple discovery strategy based on the \/etc\/hosts file.","tags":"","url":"Extending_Hazelcast\/Discovery_SPI\/index.html"},{"title":"Discovery SPI Interfaces and Classes","text":"The Hazelcast Discovery SPI (Member Discovery Extensions) consists of multiple interfaces and abstract classes. In the following sub-sections, we will have a quick look at all of them and shortly introduce the idea and usage behind them. The example will follow in the next section, Discovery Strategy. DiscoveryStrategy: Implement The com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategy interface is the main entry point for vendors to implement their corresponding member discovery strategies. Its main purpose is to return discovered members on request. The com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategy interface also offers light lifecycle capabilities for setup and teardown logic (for example, opening or closing sockets or REST API clients). DiscoveryStrategys can also do automatic registration \/ de-registration on service discovery systems if necessary. You can use the provided DiscoveryNode that is passed to the factory method to retrieve local addresses and ports, as well as metadata. AbstractDiscoveryStrategy: Abstract Class The com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.AbstractDiscoveryStrategy is a convenience abstract class meant to ease the implementation of strategies. It basically provides additional support for reading \/ resolving configuration properties and empty implementations of lifecycle methods if unnecessary. DiscoveryStrategyFactory: Factory Contract The com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategyFactory interface describes the factory contract that creates a certain DiscoveryStrategy. DiscoveryStrategyFactorys are registered automatically at startup of a Hazelcast member or client whenever they are found in the classpath. For automatic discovery, factories need to announce themselves as SPI services using a resource file according to the Java Service Provider Interface. The service registration file must be part of the JAR file, located under META-INF\/services\/com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategyFactory, and consist of a line with the full canonical class name of the DiscoveryStrategy per provided strategy implementation. DiscoveryNode: Describe a Member The com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryNode abstract class describes a member in the Discovery SPI. It is used for multiple purposes, since it will be returned from strategies for discovered members. It is also passed to DiscoveryStrategyFactorys factory method to define the local member itself if created on a Hazelcast member; on Hazelcast clients, null will be passed. SimpleDiscoveryNode: Default DiscoveryNode com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.SimpleDiscoveryNode is a default implementation of the DiscoveryNode. It is meant for convenience use of the Discovery SPI and can be returned from vendor implementations if no special needs are required. NodeFilter: Filter Members You can configure com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.NodeFilter before startup and you can implement logic to do additional filtering of members. This might be necessary if query languages for discovery strategies are not expressive enough to describe members or to overcome inefficiencies of strategy implementations. NOTE: The DiscoveryStrategy vendor does not need to take possibly configured filters into account as their use is transparent to the strategies. DiscoveryService: Support In Integrator Systems A com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.integration.DiscoveryService is part of the integration domain. DiscoveryStrategy vendors do not need to implement DiscoveryService because it is meant to support the Discovery SPI in situations where vendors integrate Hazelcast into their own systems or frameworks. Certain needs might be necessary as part of the classloading or Java Service Provider Interface lookup. DiscoveryServiceProvider: Provide a DiscoveryService Use the com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.integration.DiscoveryServiceProvider to provide a DiscoveryService to the Hazelcast discovery subsystem. Configure the provider with the Hazelcast configuration API. DiscoveryServiceSettings: Configure DiscoveryService A com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.integration.DiscoveryServiceSettings instance is passed to the DiscoveryServiceProvider at creation time to configure the DiscoveryService. DiscoveryMode: Member or Client The com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.integration.DiscoveryMode enum tells if a created DiscoveryService is running on a Hazelcast member or client, and to change behavior accordingly.","tags":"","url":"Extending_Hazelcast\/Discovery_SPI\/Discovery_SPI_Interfaces_and_Classes.html"},{"title":"Discovery Strategy","text":"This sub-section will walk through the implementation of a simple DiscoveryStrategy and their necessary setup. Discovery Strategy Example The example strategy will use the local \/etc\/hosts (and on Windows it will use the equivalent to the *nix hosts file named %SystemRoot%\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts) to lookup IP addresses of different hosts. The strategy implementation expects hosts to be configured with hostname sub-groups under the same domain. So far to theory, let's get into it. The full example's source code can be found in the Hazelcast Code Samples repository. Configuring Site Domain As a first step we do some basic configuration setup. We want the user to be able to configure the site domain for the discovery inside the hosts file, therefore we define a configuration property called site-domain. The configuration is not optional: it must be configured before the creation of the HazelcastInstance, either via XML or the Hazelcast Config API. It is recommended that you keep all defined properties in a separate configuration class as public constants (public final static) with sufficient documentation. This allows users to easily look up possible configuration values. package com.hazelcast.examples.spi.discovery; import com.hazelcast...; public class HostsDiscoveryConfiguration { \/** * 'site-domain' configures the basic site domain for the lookup, to * find other sub-domains of the cluster members and retrieve their assigned * IP addresses. *\/ public static final PropertyDefinition DOMAIN = new SimplePropertyDefinition( &quot;site-domain&quot;, PropertyTypeConverter.STRING ); \/\/ Prevent instantiation private HostsDiscoveryConfiguration() {} } An additional ValueValidator could be passed to the definition to make sure the configured value looks like a domain or has a special format. Creating Discovery As the second step we create the very simple DiscoveryStrategyFactory implementation class. To keep things clear we are going to name the discovery strategy after its purpose: looking into the hosts file. package com.hazelcast.examples.spi.discovery; import com.hazelcast...; public class HostsDiscoveryStrategyFactory implements DiscoveryStrategyFactory { private static final Collection&lt;PropertyDefinition&gt; PROPERTIES = Collections.singletonList( HostsDiscoveryConfiguration.SITE_DOMAIN ); public Class&lt;? extends DiscoveryStrategy&gt; getDiscoveryStrategyType() { \/\/ Returns the actual class type of the DiscoveryStrategy \/\/ implementation, to match it against the configuration return HostsDiscoveryStrategy.class; } public Collection&lt;PropertyDefinition&gt; getConfigurationProperties() { return PROPERTIES; } public DiscoveryStrategy newDiscoveryStrategy( DiscoveryNode discoveryNode, ILogger logger, Map&lt;String, Comparable&gt; properties ) { return new HostsDiscoveryStrategy( logger, properties ); } } This factory now defines properties known to the discovery strategy implementation and provides a clean way to instantiate it. While creating the HostsDiscoveryStrategy we ignore the passed DiscoveryNode since this strategy will not support automatic registration of new nodes. In cases where the strategy does not support registration, the environment has to handle this in some provided way. NOTE: Remember that, when created on a Hazelcast client, the provided DiscoveryNode will be null, as there is no local member in existence. Next, we register the DiscoveryStrategyFactory to make Hazelcast pick it up automatically at startup. As described earlier, this is done according to the Java Service Provider Interface specification. The filename is the name of the interface itself. Therefore we create a new resource file called com.hazelcast.spi.discovery.DiscoveryStrategyFactory and place it under META-INF\/services. The content is the full canonical class name of our factory implementation. com.hazelcast.examples.spi.discovery.HostsDiscoveryStrategyFactory If our JAR file will contain multiple factories, each consecutive line can define another full canonical DiscoveryStrategyFactory implementation class name. Implementing Discovery Strategy Now comes the interesting part. We are going to implement the discovery itself. The previous parts we did are normally pretty similar for all strategies aside from the configuration properties itself. However, implementing the discovery heavily depends on the way the strategy has to come up with IP addresses of other Hazelcast members. Extending The AbstractDiscoveryStrategy For ease of implementation, we will back our implementation by extending the AbstractDiscoveryStrategy and only implementing the absolute minimum ourselves. package com.hazelcast.examples.spi.discovery; import com.hazelcast...; public class HostsDiscoveryStrategy extends AbstractDiscoveryStrategy { private final String siteDomain; public HostsDiscoveryStrategy( ILogger logger, Map&lt;String, Comparable&gt; properties ) { super( logger, properties ); \/\/ Make it possible to override the value from the configuration on \/\/ the system's environment or JVM properties \/\/ -Ddiscovery.hosts.site-domain=some.domain this.siteDomain = getOrNull( &quot;discovery.hosts&quot;, HostsDiscoveryConfiguration.DOMAIN ); } public Iterable&lt;DiscoveryNode&gt; discoverNodes() { List&lt;String&gt; assignments = filterHosts(); return mapToDiscoveryNodes( assignments ); } \/\/ ... } Overriding Discovery Configuration So far our implementation will retrieve the configuration property for the site-domain. Our implementation offers the option to override the value from the configuration (XML or Config API) right from the system environment or JVM properties. That can be useful when the hazelcast.xml defines a setup for an developer system (like cluster.local) and operations wants to override it for the real deployment. By providing a prefix (in this case discovery.hosts) we created an external property named discovery.hosts.site-domain which can be set as an environment variable or passed as a JVM property from the startup script. The lookup priority is explained in the following list, priority is from top to bottom: JVM properties (or hazelcast.xml section) System environment Configuration properties Implementing Lookup Since we now have the value for our property we can implement the actual lookup and mapping as already prepared in the discoverNodes method. The following part is very specific to this special discovery strategy, for completeness we're showing it anyways. private static final String HOSTS_NIX = &quot;\/etc\/hosts&quot;; private static final String HOSTS_WINDOWS = &quot;%SystemRoot%\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\etc\\\\hosts&quot;; private List&lt;String&gt; filterHosts() { String os = System.getProperty( &quot;os.name&quot; ); String hostsPath; if ( os.contains( &quot;Windows&quot; ) ) { hostsPath = HOSTS_WINDOWS; } else { hostsPath = HOSTS_NIX; } File hosts = new File( hostsPath ); \/\/ Read all lines List&lt;String&gt; lines = readLines( hosts ); List&lt;String&gt; assignments = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); for ( String line : lines ) { \/\/ Example: \/\/ 192.168.0.1 host1.cluster.local if ( matchesDomain( line ) ) { assignments.add( line ); } } return assignments; } Mapping to DiscoveryNodes After we now collected the address assignments configured in the hosts file we can go to the final step and map those to the DiscoveryNodes to return them from our strategy. private Iterable&lt;DiscoveryNode&gt; mapToDiscoveryNodes( List&lt;String&gt; assignments ) { Collection&lt;DiscoveryNode&gt; discoveredNodes = new ArrayList&lt;DiscoveryNode&gt;(); for ( String assignment : assignments ) { String address = sliceAddress( assignment ); String hostname = sliceHostname( assignment ); Map&lt;String, Object&gt; attributes = Collections.singletonMap( &quot;hostname&quot;, hostname ); InetAddress inetAddress = mapToInetAddress( address ); Address addr = new Address( inetAddress, NetworkConfig.DEFAULT_PORT ); discoveredNodes.add( new SimpleDiscoveryNode( addr, attributes ) ); } return discoveredNodes; } With that mapping we now have a full discovery, executed whenever Hazelcast asks for IPs. So why don't we read them in once and cache them? The answer is simple, it might happen that members go down or come up over time. Since we expect the hosts file to be injected into the running container it also might change over time. We want to get the latest available members, therefore we read the file on request. Configuring DiscoveryStrategy To actually use the new DiscoveryStrategy implementation we need to configure it like in the following example: &lt;hazelcast&gt; &lt;!-- activate Discovery SPI --&gt; &lt;properties&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;hazelcast.discovery.enabled&quot;&gt;true&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;\/properties&gt; &lt;network&gt; &lt;join&gt; &lt;!-- deactivating other discoveries --&gt; &lt;multicast enabled=&quot;false&quot;\/&gt; &lt;tcp-ip enabled=&quot;false&quot; \/&gt; &lt;aws enabled=&quot;false&quot;\/&gt; &lt;!-- activate our discovery strategy --&gt; &lt;discovery-strategies&gt; &lt;!-- class equals to the DiscoveryStrategy not the factory! --&gt; &lt;discovery-strategy enabled=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;com.hazelcast.examples.spi.discovery.HostsDiscoveryStrategy&quot;&gt; &lt;properties&gt; &lt;property name=&quot;site-domain&quot;&gt;cluster.local&lt;\/property&gt; &lt;\/properties&gt; &lt;\/discovery-strategy&gt; &lt;\/discovery-strategies&gt; &lt;\/join&gt; &lt;\/network&gt; &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; To find out further details, please have a look at the Discovery SPI Javadoc.","tags":"","url":"Extending_Hazelcast\/Discovery_SPI\/Discovery_Strategy.html"},{"title":"DiscoveryService-Framework Integration","text":"Since the DiscoveryStrategy is meant for cloud vendors or implementors of service discovery systems, the DiscoveryService is meant for integrators.

Integrators can extend or implement their own DiscoveryService and DiscoveryServiceProvider and inject it using the Hazelcast Config API (com.hazelcast.config.DiscoveryConfig) prior to instantiating the HazelcastInstance. In any case, integrators might have to remember that a DiscoveryService might have to change behavior based on the runtime environment (Hazelcast member or client), and then the DiscoveryServiceSettings should provide information about the started HazelcastInstance.

Config Properties SPI Classes The Config Properties SPI consists of a small set of classes and provided implementations. PropertyDefinition: Define a Single Property The com.hazelcast.config.properties.PropertyDefinition interface defines a single property inside a given configuration. It consists of a key string and type (in form of a com.hazelcast.core.TypeConverter). You can mark properties as optional and you can have an additional validation step to make sure the provided value matches certain rules (like port numbers must be between 0-65535 or similar). SimplePropertyDefinition: Basic PropertyDefinition For convenience, the com.hazelcast.config.properties.SimplePropertyDefinition class is provided. This class is a basic implementation of the PropertyDefinition interface and should be enough for most situations. In case of additional needs, you are free to provide your own implementation of the PropertyDefinition interface. PropertyTypeConverter: Set of TypeConverters The com.hazelcast.config.properties.PropertyTypeConverter enum provides a preset of TypeConverters. Provided are the most common basic types: String Short Integer Long Float Double Boolean ValueValidator and ValidationException The com.hazelcast.config.properties.ValueValidator interface implements additional value validation. The configured value will be validated before it is returned to the requester. If validation fails, a com.hazelcast.config.properties.ValidationException is thrown and the requester has to handle it or throw the exception further. Config Properties SPI Example This sub-section will show a quick example of how to setup, configure and use the Config Properties SPI. Defining a Config PropertyDefinition Defining a property is as easy as giving it a name and a type. PropertyDefinition property = new SimplePropertyDefinition( &quot;my-key&quot;, PropertyTypeConverter.STRING ); We defined a property named my-key with a type of a string. If none of the predefined TypeConverters matches the need, users are free to provide their own implementation.

Retrieving a PropertyDefinition Value To eventually retrieve a value, use the PropertyDefinition to get and convert the value automatically. public &lt;T&gt; T getConfig( PropertyDefinition property, Map&lt;String, Comparable&gt; properties ) { Map&lt;String, Comparable&gt; properties = ...; TypeConverter typeConverter = property.typeConverter(); Comparable value = properties.get( property.key() ); return typeConverter.convert( value ); }","tags":"","url":"Extending_Hazelcast\/Config_Properties_.html"},{"title":"Split Brain Syndrome","text":"Imagine that you have a cluster with ten members and that the network is divided into two in a way that four members cannot see the other six members. As a result, you end up having two separate clusters: one with four members and one with six members. Members in each sub-cluster think that the other members are dead even though they are not. This situation is called Network Partitioning (a.k.a. Split-Brain Syndrome). However, these two clusters have a combination of the 271 (using default) primary and backup partitions. It is very likely that not all of the 271 partitions, including both primaries and backups, exist in both mini-clusters. Therefore, from each mini-cluster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective, data has been lost as some partitions no longer exist (they exist on the other segment). Understanding Partition Recreation If a MapStore was in use, those lost partitions would be reloaded from some database, making each mini-cluster complete. Each mini-cluster will then recreate the missing primary partitions and continue to store data in them, including backups on the other members. Understanding Backup Partition Creation When primary partitions exist without a backup, a backup version problem will be detected and a backup partition will be created. When backups exist without a primary, the backups will be promoted to primary partitions and new backups will be created with proper versioning. At this time, both mini-clusters have repaired themselves with all 271 partitions with backups, and continue to handle traffic without any knowledge of each other. Given that they have enough remaining memory (assumption), they are just smaller and can handle less throughput. Understanding The Update Overwrite Scenario If a MapStore is in use and the network to the database is available, one or both of the mini-clusters will write updates to the same database. There is a potential for the mini-clusters to overwrite the same cache entry records if modified in both mini-clusters. This overwrite scenario represents a potential data loss, and thus the database design should consider an insert and aggregate on read or version strategy rather than update records in place. If the network to the database is not available, then based on the configured or coded consistency level or transaction, entry updates are held in cache or updates are rejected (fully synchronous and consistent). When held in cache, the updates will be considered dirty and will be written to the database when it becomes available. You can view the dirty entry counts per cluster member in the Management Center web console (please see the Map Monitoring section). What Happens When The Network Failure Is Fixed Since it is a network failure, there is no way to programmatically avoid your application running as two separate independent clusters. But what will happen after the network failure is fixed and connectivity is restored between these two clusters? Will these two clusters merge into one again? If they do, how are the data conflicts resolved, because you might end up having two different values for the same key in the same map? When the network is restored, all 271 partitions should exist in both mini-clusters and they should all undergo the merge. Once all primaries are merged, all backups are rewritten so their versions are correct. You may want to write a merge policy using the MapMergePolicy interface that rebuilds the entry from the database rather than from memory. The only metadata available for merge decisions are from the EntryView interface that includes object size (cost), hits count, last updated\/stored dates, and a version number that starts at zero and is incremented for each entry update. You could also create your own versioning scheme or capture a time series of deltas to reconstruct an entry. How Hazelcast Split-Brain Merge Happens Here is, step by step, how Hazelcast split-brain merge happens: The oldest member of the cluster checks if there is another cluster with the same group-name and group-password in the network. If the oldest member finds such a cluster, then it figures out which cluster should merge to the other. Each member of the merging cluster will do the following. Pause. Take locally owned map entries. Close all of its network connections (detach from its cluster). Join to the new cluster. Send merge request for each of its locally owned map entry. Resume. Each member of the merging cluster rejoins the new cluster and sends a merge request for each of its locally owned map entries. Two important points: The smaller cluster will merge into the bigger one. If they have equal number of members then a hashing algorithm determines the merging cluster. Each cluster may have different versions of the same key in the same map. The destination cluster will decide how to handle merging entry based on the MergePolicy set for that map. There are built-in merge policies such as PassThroughMergePolicy, PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy, HigherHitsMapMergePolicy and LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy. You can develop your own merge policy by implementing com.hazelcast.map.merge.MapMergePolicy. You should set the full class name of your implementation to the merge-policy configuration. public interface MergePolicy { \/** * Returns the value of the entry after the merge * of entries with the same key. Returning value can be * You should consider the case where existingEntry is null. * * @param mapName name of the map * @param mergingEntry entry merging into the destination cluster * @param existingEntry existing entry in the destination cluster * @return final value of the entry. If returns null then entry will be removed. *\/ Object merge( String mapName, EntryView mergingEntry, EntryView existingEntry ); } Specifying Merge Policies Here is how merge policies are specified per map: &lt;hazelcast&gt; ... &lt;map name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; &lt;backup-count&gt;1&lt;\/backup-count&gt; &lt;eviction-policy&gt;NONE&lt;\/eviction-policy&gt; &lt;max-size&gt;0&lt;\/max-size&gt; &lt;eviction-percentage&gt;25&lt;\/eviction-percentage&gt; &lt;!-- While recovering from split-brain (network partitioning), map entries in the small cluster will merge into the bigger cluster based on the policy set here. When an entry merge into the cluster, there might an existing entry with the same key already. Values of these entries might be different for that same key. Which value should be set for the key? Conflict is resolved by the policy set here. Default policy is hz.ADD_NEW_ENTRY There are built-in merge policies such as There are built-in merge policies such as com.hazelcast.map.merge.PassThroughMergePolicy; entry will be added if there is no existing entry for the key. com.hazelcast.map.merge.PutIfAbsentMapMergePolicy ; entry will be added if the merging entry doesn't exist in the cluster. com.hazelcast.map.merge.HigherHitsMapMergePolicy ; entry with the higher hits wins. com.hazelcast.map.merge.LatestUpdateMapMergePolicy ; entry with the latest update wins. --&gt; &lt;merge-policy&gt;MY_MERGE_POLICY_CLASS&lt;\/merge-policy&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; ... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; NOTE: Map is the only Hazelcast distributed data structure that merges after a split-brain syndrome. For the other data structures, e.g., Queue, Topic and IdGenerator, one instance of that data structure is chosen after split-brain syndrome.","tags":"","url":"Network_Partitioning\/Split_Brain_Syndrome.html"},{"title":"Split Brain Protection","text":"Split-Brain Protection How to respond to a split-brain scenario depends on whether consistency of data or availability of your application is of primary concern. In either case, because a split-brain scenario is caused by a network failure, you must initiate an effort to identify and correct the network failure. Your cluster cannot be brought back to steady state operation until the underlying network failure is fixed. If consistency is your primary concern, you can use Hazelcast's Split-Brain Protection feature. Hazelcast's Split-Brain Protection enables you to specify the minimum cluster size required for operations to occur. This is achieved by defining and configuring a split-brain protection cluster quorum. If the cluster size is below the defined quorum, the operations are rejected and the rejected operations return a QuorumException to their callers. Your application continues its operations on the remaining operating cluster. Any application instances connected to the cluster with sizes below the defined quorum will be receiving exceptions which, depending on the programming and monitoring setup, should generate alerts. The key point is that rather than applications continuing in error with stale data, they are prevented from doing so. Split-Brain Protection is supported for the following Hazelcast data structures: Map (for Hazelcast 3.5 and higher versions) Transactional Map (for Hazelcast 3.5 and higher versions) Cache (for Hazelcast 3.5 and higher versions) Lock (for Hazelcast 3.8 and higher versions) Queue (for Hazelcast 3.8 and higher versions) Each data structure to be protected should have the quorum configuration added to it as explained in the Configuring Quorum section below. Time Window for Split-Brain Protection Cluster Membership is established and maintained by heartbeats. A network partitioning will present some members as being unreachable. While configurable, it is normally seconds or tens of seconds before the cluster is adjusted to exclude unreachable members. The cluster size is based on the currently understood number of members. For this reason, there will be a time window between the network partitioning and the application of Split-Brain Protection. Configuring Quorum You can set up Split-Brain Protection Cluster Quorum using either declarative or programmatic configuration. Assume that you have a 7-member Hazelcast Cluster and you want to set the minimum number of four members for the cluster to continue operating. In this case, if a split-brain happens, the sub-clusters of sizes 1, 2, and 3 will be prevented from being used. Only the sub-cluster of four members will be allowed to be used. NOTE: It is preferable to have an odd-sized initial cluster size to prevent a single network partitioning (split-brain) from creating two equal sized clusters. The following are map configurations for the example 7-member cluster scenario described above: Declarative: &lt;hazelcast&gt; .... &lt;quorum name=&quot;quorumRuleWithFourMembers&quot; enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;quorum-size&gt;4&lt;\/quorum-size&gt; &lt;\/quorum&gt; &lt;map name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; &lt;quorum-ref&gt;quorumRuleWithFourMembers&lt;\/quorum-ref&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; .... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; Programmatic: QuorumConfig quorumConfig = new QuorumConfig(); quorumConfig.setName(&quot;quorumRuleWithFourMembers&quot;) quorumConfig.setEnabled(true); quorumConfig.setSize(4); MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig(); mapConfig.setQuorumName(&quot;quorumRuleWithFourMembers&quot;); Config config = new Config(); config.addQuorumConfig(quorumConfig); config.addMapConfig(mapConfig); Quorum configuration has the following elements. quorum-size: Minimum number of members required in a cluster for the cluster to remain in an operational state. If the number of members is below the defined minimum at any time, the operations are rejected and the rejected operations return a QuorumException to their callers. quorum-type: Type of the cluster quorum. Available values are READ, WRITE and READ_WRITE. Configuring Quorum Listeners You can register quorum listeners to be notified about quorum results. Quorum listeners are local to the member where they are registered, so they receive only events that occurred on that local member. Quorum listeners can be configured via declarative or programmatic configuration. The following examples are such configurations. Declarative: &lt;hazelcast&gt; .... &lt;quorum name=&quot;quorumRuleWithFourMembers&quot; enabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; &lt;quorum-size&gt;4&lt;\/quorum-size&gt; &lt;quorum-listeners&gt; &lt;quorum-listener&gt;com.company.quorum.FourMemberQuorumListener&lt;\/quorum-listener&gt; &lt;\/quorum-listeners&gt; &lt;\/quorum&gt; &lt;map name=&quot;default&quot;&gt; &lt;quorum-ref&gt;quorumRuleWithFourMembers&lt;\/quorum-ref&gt; &lt;\/map&gt; .... &lt;\/hazelcast&gt; Programmatic: QuorumListenerConfig listenerConfig = new QuorumListenerConfig(); \/\/ You can either directly set quorum listener implementation of your own listenerConfig.setImplementation(new QuorumListener() { @Override public void onChange(QuorumEvent quorumEvent) { if (quorumEvent.isPresent()) { \/\/ handle quorum presence } else { \/\/ handle quorum absence } } }); \/\/ Or you can give the name of the class that implements QuorumListener interface. listenerConfig.setClassName(&quot;com.company.quorum.ThreeMemberQuorumListener&quot;); QuorumConfig quorumConfig = new QuorumConfig(); quorumConfig.setName(&quot;quorumRuleWithFourMembers&quot;) quorumConfig.setEnabled(true); quorumConfig.setSize(4); quorumConfig.addListenerConfig(listenerConfig); MapConfig mapConfig = new MapConfig(); mapConfig.setQuorumName(&quot;quorumRuleWithFourMembers&quot;); Config config = new Config(); config.addQuorumConfig(quorumConfig); config.addMapConfig(mapConfig); Querying Quorum Results Split Brain Protection Quorum service gives you the ability to query quorum results over the Quorum instances. Quorum instances let you query the result of a particular quorum.

In most cases, the overhead of inter-thread communications overweight can benefit from parallel execution. When you have a large dataset and\/or slow predicate, you may benefit from parallel predicate evaluations. Set to true if you are using slow predicates or have &gt; 100,000s entries per member. hazelcast.query.result.size.limit -1 int Result size limit for query operations on maps. This value defines the maximum number of returned elements for a single query result. If a query exceeds this number of elements, a QueryResultSizeExceededException is thrown.

If you have a very fast network, e.g., 10gbit) and\/or you have large entries, then you may benefit from increasing sender\/receiver buffer sizes. Use this property and the next one below tune the size. For example, a send\/receive buffer size of 1024 kB is a safe starting point for a 10gbit network. hazelcast.socket.send.buffer.size 32 int Socket send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) size in KB. hazelcast.socket.server.bind.any true bool Bind server-socket to any local interface. If not set, hazelcast.socket.bind.any will be used as default. hazelcast.tcp.join.port.try.count 3 int The number of incremental ports, starting with the port number defined in the network configuration, that will be used to connect to a host (which is defined without a port in TCP\/IP member list while a member is searching for a cluster). hazelcast.unsafe.mode auto string &quot;auto&quot; (the default value) automatically detects whether the usage of Unsafe is suitable for a given platform. &quot;disabled&quot; explicitly disables the Unsafe usage in your platform. &quot;enforced&quot; enforces the usage of Unsafe even if your platform does not support it.

The partition count of 271, being a prime number, is a good choice because it will be distributed to the members almost evenly. For a small to medium sized cluster, the count of 271 gives an almost even partition distribution and optimal-sized partitions. As your cluster becomes bigger, you should make this count bigger to have evenly distributed partitions. Is Hazelcast thread safe? Yes. All Hazelcast data structures are thread safe. How do members discover each other? When a member is started in a cluster, it will dynamically and automatically be discovered. There are three types of discovery. Multicast discovery: members in a cluster discover each other by multicast, by default. Discovery by TCP\/IP: the first member created in the cluster (leader) will form a list of IP addresses of other joining members and will send this list to these members so the members will know each other. If your application is placed on Amazon EC2, Hazelcast has an automatic discovery mechanism. You will give your Amazon credentials and the joining member will be discovered automatically. Once members are discovered, all the communication between them will be via TCP\/IP. RELATED INFORMATION Please refer to the Discovering Cluster Members section for detailed information. What happens when a member goes down? Once a member is gone (crashes), the following happens since data in each member has a backup in other members. First, the backups in other members are restored. Then, data from these restored backups are recovered. And finally, backups for these recovered data are formed. So eventually, no data is lost. How do I test the connectivity? If you notice that there is a problem with a member joining a cluster, you may want to perform a connectivity test between the member to be joined and a member from the cluster. You can use the iperf tool for this purpose. For example, you can execute the below command on one member (i.e. listening on port 5701). iperf -s -p 5701 And you can execute the below command on the other member. iperf -c &lt;IP address&gt; -d -p 5701 The output should include connection information, such as the IP addresses, transfer speed, and bandwidth. Otherwise, if the output says No route to host, it means a network connection problem exists. How do I choose keys properly? When you store a key and value in a distributed Map, Hazelcast serializes the key and value, and stores the byte array version of them in local ConcurrentHashMaps. These ConcurrentHashMaps use equals and hashCode methods of byte array version of your key. It does not take into account the actual equals and hashCode implementations of your objects. So it is important that you choose your keys in a proper way. Implementing equals and hashCode is not enough, it is also important that the object is always serialized into the same byte array. All primitive types like String, Long, Integer, etc. are good candidates for keys to be used in Hazelcast. An unsorted Set is an example of a very bad candidate because Java Serialization may serialize the same unsorted set in two different byte arrays. How do I reflect value modifications? Hazelcast always return a clone copy of a value. Modifying the returned value does not change the actual value in the map (or multimap, list, set). You should put the modified value back to make changes visible to all members. V value = map.get( key ); value.updateSomeProperty(); map.put( key, value ); Collections which return values of methods (such as IMap.keySet, IMap.values, IMap.entrySet, MultiMap.get, MultiMap.remove, IMap.keySet, IMap.values) contain cloned values. These collections are NOT backed up by related Hazelcast objects. Therefore, changes to them are NOT reflected in the originals, and vice-versa. How do I test my Hazelcast cluster? Hazelcast allows you to create more than one instance on the same JVM. Each member is called HazelcastInstance and each will have its own configuration, socket and threads, so you can treat them as totally separate instances. This enables you to write and to run cluster unit tests on a single JVM. Because you can use this feature for creating separate members different applications running on the same JVM (imagine running multiple web applications on the same JVM), you can also use this feature for testing your Hazelcast cluster. Let's say you want to test if two members have the same size of a map. @Test public void testTwoMemberMapSizes() { \/\/ start the first member HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); \/\/ get the map and put 1000 entries Map map1 = h1.getMap( &quot;testmap&quot; ); for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++ ) { map1.put( i, &quot;value&quot; + i ); } \/\/ check the map size assertEquals( 1000, map1.size() ); \/\/ start the second member HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); \/\/ get the same map from the second member Map map2 = h2.getMap( &quot;testmap&quot; ); \/\/ check the size of map2 assertEquals( 1000, map2.size() ); \/\/ check the size of map1 again assertEquals( 1000, map1.size() ); } In the test above, everything happens in the same thread. When developing a multi-threaded test, you need to carefully handle coordination of the thread executions. it is highly recommended that you use CountDownLatch for thread coordination (you can certainly use other ways). Here is an example where we need to listen for messages and make sure that we got these messages. @Test public void testTopic() { \/\/ start two member cluster HazelcastInstance h1 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); HazelcastInstance h2 = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); String topicName = &quot;TestMessages&quot;; \/\/ get a topic from the first member and add a messageListener ITopic&lt;String&gt; topic1 = h1.getTopic( topicName ); final CountDownLatch latch1 = new CountDownLatch( 1 ); topic1.addMessageListener( new MessageListener() { public void onMessage( Object msg ) { assertEquals( &quot;Test1&quot;, msg ); latch1.countDown(); } }); \/\/ get a topic from the second member and add a messageListener ITopic&lt;String&gt; topic2 = h2.getTopic(topicName); final CountDownLatch latch2 = new CountDownLatch( 2 ); topic2.addMessageListener( new MessageListener() { public void onMessage( Object msg ) { assertEquals( &quot;Test1&quot;, msg ); latch2.countDown(); } } ); \/\/ publish the first message, both should receive this topic1.publish( &quot;Test1&quot; ); \/\/ shutdown the first member h1.shutdown(); \/\/ publish the second message, second member's topic should receive this topic2.publish( &quot;Test1&quot; ); try { \/\/ assert that the first member's topic got the message assertTrue( latch1.await( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) ); \/\/ assert that the second members' topic got two messages assertTrue( latch2.await( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS ) ); } catch ( InterruptedException ignored ) { } } You can start Hazelcast members with different configurations. Remember to call Hazelcast.shutdownAll() after each test case to make sure that there is no other running member left from the previous tests. @After public void cleanup() throws Exception { Hazelcast.shutdownAll(); } For more information please check our existing tests. Does Hazelcast support hundreds of members? Yes. Hazelcast performed a successful test on Amazon EC2 with 200 members. Does Hazelcast support thousands of clients? Yes. However, there are some points you should consider. The environment should be LAN with a high stability and the network speed should be 10 Gbps or higher. If the number of members is high, the client type should be selected as Dummy, not Smart Client. In the case of Smart Clients, since each client will open a connection to the members, these members should be powerful enough (for example, more cores) to handle hundreds or thousands of connections and client requests. Also, you should consider using near caches in clients to lower the network traffic. And you should use the Hazelcast releases with the NIO implementation (which starts with Hazelcast 3.2). Also, you should configure the clients attentively. Please refer to the Java Client section for configuration notes. Difference between Lite Member and Smart Client? Lite member supports task execution (distributed executor service), smart client does not. Also, Lite Member is highly coupled with cluster, smart client is not. How do you give support? We have two support services: community and commercial support. Community support is provided through our Mail Group and StackOverflow web site. For information on support subscriptions, please see Hazelcast.com. Does Hazelcast persist? No. However, Hazelcast provides MapStore and MapLoader interfaces. For example, when you implement the MapStore interface, Hazelcast calls your store and load methods whenever needed. Can I use Hazelcast in a single server? Yes. But please note that Hazelcast's main design focus is multi-member clusters to be used as a distribution platform. How can I monitor Hazelcast? Hazelcast Management Center is what you use to monitor and manage the members running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring the overall state of a cluster, you can analyze and browse data structures in detail, you can update map configurations, and you can take thread dumps from members. Moreover, JMX monitoring is also provided. Please see the Monitoring with JMX section for details. How can I see debug level logs? By changing the log level to &quot;Debug&quot;. Below are sample lines for log4j logging framework. Please see the Logging Configuration section to learn how to set logging types. First, set the logging type as follows. String location = &quot;log4j.configuration&quot;; String logging = &quot;hazelcast.logging.type&quot;; System.setProperty( logging, &quot;log4j&quot; ); \/**if you want to give a new location. **\/ System.setProperty( location, &quot;file:\/path\/mylog4j.properties&quot; ); Then set the log level to &quot;Debug&quot; in the properties file. Below is example content. # direct log messages to stdout # log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender log4j.appender.stdout.Target=System.out log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ABSOLUTE} %5p [%c{1}] - %m%n log4j.logger.com.hazelcast=debug #log4j.logger.com.hazelcast.cluster=debug #log4j.logger.com.hazelcast.partition=debug #log4j.logger.com.hazelcast.partition.InternalPartitionService=debug #log4j.logger.com.hazelcast.nio=debug #log4j.logger.com.hazelcast.hibernate=debug The line log4j.logger.com.hazelcast=debug is used to see debug logs for all Hazelcast operations. Below this line, you can select to see specific logs (cluster, partition, hibernate, etc.). Client-server vs. embedded topologies? In the embedded topology, members include both the data and application. This type of topology is the most useful if your application focuses on high performance computing and many task executions. Since application is close to data, this topology supports data locality. In the client-server topology, you create a cluster of members and scale the cluster independently. Your applications are hosted on the clients, and the clients communicate with the members in the cluster to reach data. Client-server topology fits better if there are multiple applications sharing the same data or if application deployment is significantly greater than the cluster size (for example, 500 application servers vs. 10 member cluster). How do I know it is safe to kill the second member? Below code snippet shuts down the cluster members if the cluster is safe for a member shutdown. PartitionService partitionService = hazelcastInstance.getPartitionService(); if (partitionService.isClusterSafe()) { hazelcastInstance.shutdown(); \/\/ or terminate } Below code snippet shuts down the local member if the member is safe to be shutdown. PartitionService partitionService = hazelcastInstance.getPartitionService(); if (partitionService.isLocalMemberSafe()) { hazelcastInstance.shutdown(); \/\/ or terminate } RELATED INFORMATION Please refer to Safety Checking Cluster Members for more information. When do I need Native Memory solutions? Native Memory solutions can be preferred: when the amount of data per member is large enough to create significant garbage collection pauses. when your application requires predictable latency. Is there any disadvantage of using near-cache? The only disadvantage when using Near Cache is that it may cause stale reads. Is Hazelcast secure? Hazelcast supports symmetric encryption, secure sockets layer (SSL), and Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS). Please see the Security chapter for more information. How can I set socket options? Hazelcast allows you to set some socket options such as SO_KEEPALIVE, SO_SNDBUF, and SO_RCVBUF using Hazelcast configuration properties. Please see hazelcast.socket.* properties explained in the System Properties section. Client disconnections during idle time? In Hazelcast, socket connections are created with the SO_KEEPALIVE option enabled by default. In most operating systems, default keep-alive time is 2 hours. If you have a firewall between clients and servers which is configured to reset idle connections\/sessions, make sure that the firewall's idle timeout is greater than the TCP keep-alive defined in the OS. For additional information please see: Using TCP keepalive under Linux Microsoft TechNet OOME: Unable to create new native thread? If you encounter an error of java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread, it may be caused by exceeding the available file descriptors on your operating system, especially if it is Linux. This exception is usually thrown on a running member, after a period of time when the thread count exhausts the file descriptor availability. The JVM on Linux consumes a file descriptor for each thread created. The default number of file descriptors available in Linux is usually 1024. If you have many JVMs running on a single machine, it is possible to exceed this default number. You can view the limit using the following command. # ulimit -a At the operating system level, Linux users can control the amount of resources (and in particular, file descriptors) used via one of the following options. 1 - Editing the limits.conf file: # vi \/etc\/security\/limits.conf testuser soft nofile 4096&lt;br&gt; testuser hard nofile 10240&lt;br&gt; 2 - Or using the ulimit command: # ulimit -Hn 10240 The default number of process per users is 1024. Adding the following to your $HOME\/.profile could solve the issue: # ulimit -u 4096 Does repartitioning wait for Entry Processor? Repartitioning is the process of redistributing the partition ownerships. Hazelcast performs the repartitioning in the cases where a member leaves the cluster or joins the cluster. If a repartitioning will happen while an entry processor is active in a member processing on an entry object, the repartitioning waits for the entry processor to complete its job. Instances on different machines cannot see each other? Assume you have two instances on two different machines and you develop a configuration as shown below. Config config = new Config(); NetworkConfig network = config.getNetworkConfig(); JoinConfig join = network.getJoin(); join.getMulticastConfig().setEnabled(false); join.getTcpIpConfig().addMember(&quot;IP1&quot;) .addMember(&quot;IP2&quot;).setEnabled(true); network.getInterfaces().setEnabled(true) .addInterface(&quot;IP1&quot;).addInterface(&quot;IP2&quot;); When you create the Hazelcast instance, you have to pass the configuration to the instance. If you create the instances without passing the configuration, each instance starts but cannot see each other. Therefore, a correct way to create the instance is the following: HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config); The following is an incorrect way: HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(); What Does &quot;Replica: 1 has no owner&quot; Mean? When you start more members after the first one is started, you will see replica: 1 has no owner entry in the newly started member's log. There is no need to worry about it since it refers to a transitory state. It only means the replica partition is not ready\/assigned yet and eventually it will be.","tags":"","url":"FAQ.html"},{"title":"Glossary","text":"Term Definition 2-phase Commit 2-phase commit protocol is an atomic commitment protocol for distributed systems. It consists of two phases: commit-request and commit. In commit-request phase, transaction manager coordinates all of the transaction resources to commit or abort. In commit-phase, transaction manager decides to finalize operation by committing or aborting according to the votes of the each transaction resource. ACID A set of properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guaranteeing that transactions are processed reliably. Atomicity requires that each transaction be all or nothing (i.e. if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction will fail). Consistency ensures that only valid data following all rules and constraints is written. Isolation ensures that transactions are securely and independently processed at the same time without interference (and without transaction ordering). Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, no matter if there is a power loss, crash, or error. Cache A high-speed access area that can be either a reserved section of main memory or storage device. Client Server Topology Hazelcast topology where members run outside the user application, and are connected to clients using client libraries. The client library is installed in the user application. Embedded Topology Hazelcast topology where the members are in-process with the user application and act as both client and server. Garbage Collection Garbage collection is the recovery of storage that is being used by an application when that application no longer needs the storage. This frees the storage for use by other applications (or processes within an application). It also ensures that an application using increasing amounts of storage does not reach its quota. Programming languages that use garbage collection are often interpreted within virtual machines like the JVM. The environment that runs the code is also responsible for garbage collection. Hazelcast Cluster A virtual environment formed by Hazelcast members communicating with each other in the cluster. Hazelcast Partitions Memory segments containing the data. Hazelcast is built-on the partition concept, it uses partitions to store and process data. Each partition can have hundreds or thousands of data entries depending on your memory capacity. You can think of a partition as a block of data. In general and optimally, a partition should have a maximum size of 50-100 Megabytes. IMDG An in-memory data grid (IMDG) is a data structure that resides entirely in memory, and is distributed among many members in a single location or across multiple locations. IMDGs can support thousands of in-memory data updates per second, and they can be clustered and scaled in ways that support large quantities of data. Invalidation The process of marking an object as being invalid across the distributed cache. Java heap Java heap is the space that Java can reserve and use in memory for dynamic memory allocation. All runtime objects created by a Java application are stored in heap. By default, the heap size is 128 MB, but this limit is reached easily for business applications. Once the heap is full, new objects cannot be created and the Java application shows errors. LRU, LFU LRU and LFU are two of eviction algorithms. LRU is the abbreviation for Least Recently Used. It refers to entries eligible for eviction due to lack of interest by applications. LFU is the abbreviation for Least Frequently Used. It refers to the entries eligible for eviction due to having the lowest usage frequency. Member A Hazelcast instance. Depending on your Hazelcast usage, it can refer to a server or a Java virtual machine (JVM). Members belong to a Hazelcast cluster. Members are also referred as member nodes, cluster members, or Hazelcast members. Multicast A type of communication where data is addressed to a group of destination members simultaneously. Near Cache A caching model. When near cache is enabled, an object retrieved from a remote member is put into the local cache and the future requests made to this object will be handled by this local member. For example, if you have a map with data that is mostly read, then using near cache is a good idea. NoSQL &quot;Not Only SQL&quot;. A database model that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is tailored in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. It is a type of database which does not adhering to the traditional relational database management system (RDMS) structure. It is not built on tables and does not employ SQL to manipulate data. It also may not provide full ACID guarantees, but still has a distributed and fault tolerant architecture. OSGI Formerly known as the Open Services Gateway initiative, it describes a modular system and a service platform for the Java programming language that implements a complete and dynamic component model. Partition Table Table containing all members in the cluster, mappings of partitions to members, and further metadata. Race Condition This condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. RSA An algorithm developed by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman to generate, encrypt and decrypt keys for secure data transmissions. Serialization Process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization. Split Brain Split brain syndrome, in a clustering context, is a state in which a cluster of members gets divided (or partitioned) into smaller clusters of members, each of which believes it is the only active cluster. Transaction Means a sequence of information exchange and related work (such as data store updating) that is treated as a unit for the purposes of satisfying a request and for ensuring data store integrity.","tags":"","url":"Glossary.html"}]}
